<ul>
<li>while the boundaries of a match normally correspond with the start and end of a pattern, we can use <code>\zs</code> and <code>\ze</code> to crop the beginning and end of a match, making the new match a subset of the pattern
<ul>
<li>ex. search for matches of "eagle", but only when it follows the word "bald"
<pre><code>- `/bald \zseagle`
</code></pre>
In this example, "bald eagle" still forms part of the pattern, but only the word "eagle" is matched</li>
<li>ex. search for everything inside quotes, without the quotes themselves
<ul>
<li><code>/\v"\zs[^"]+\ze"</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Lookarounds are zero-length assertions, meaning they don't take place on a character of the string; they take place between characters.</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/midPuyHDHxnZW01AbRXde">quantifiers</a> zero-length nature is that lookaround actually matches characters, but then gives up the match, returning only the result: match or no match.
<ul>
<li>ie. They do not consume characters in the string, but only assert whether a match is possible or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lookaround allows you to create regular expressions that are impossible to create without them, or that would get very longwinded without them.</li>
</ul>
