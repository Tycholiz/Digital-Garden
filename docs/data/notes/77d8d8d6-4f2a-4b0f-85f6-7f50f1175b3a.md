### Resource
A resource is any computer component of limited supply
- a [[file descriptor|dendron://tech/unix.streams#file-descriptor-fd]] is a resource because a system can only handle so many
- a network connection is a resource because there are only so many network sockets
- memory is a resource because a computer only has so much memory
