With a 3D modeling software like Blender, artists model the shape of a 3D object, **rig** it so that it can be animated, **animate** it to move in a particular way, and **texture** it to give it color and shading. An example of this is shown below.

Unity has a quick n' dirty implementation of a 3D modeler called [ProBuilder](https://unity.com/features/probuilder) 

The reason why we use triangles to represent 3D graphics is because no matter where (in 3D space) you put the 3 points of a triangle, it is always 2D. 
- With 4 points, we can make more complex objects, such as a pyramid, which would be more mathematically complex and require higher processing power just to figure out the pixels on the surface.
