<li>the cursor is the thing that allows us to traverse over records in a database</li>
<li>A cursor can be viewed as a pointer to one row within a set of rows</li>
<li>cursors also facilitate retrieval of the records, as well as creating and removing records</li>
<li>a cursor is conceptually and behaviourally very similar to an iterator</li>
<li>Cursors are used to process individual rows returned by database system queries</li>
<li>a cursor makes it possible to define a result set and perform complex logic on it, on a row by row basis</li>
