<p>A cursor is a piece of data (likely just an ID) that points to a location in a paginated list (ie. a single page).</p>
<ul>
<li>the cursor is the thing that allows a user to traverse over records in a database</li>
</ul>
<p>A cursor conceptually has a <code>next()</code> method (which gets the next page of the larger dataset) and <code>forEach()</code> (which allows some code to be exectuted for each page of the whole dataset).</p>
<ul>
<li>cursors may also implement helper methods like <code>toArray()</code>, which will allow us extract the data in an array format. </li>
</ul>
<p>A cursor can be viewed as a pointer to one (or many) row(s) within a larger dataset.</p>
<p>Cursors also facilitate retrieval of the records, as well as creating and removing records</p>
<p>A cursor is conceptually and behaviourally very similar to an <a href="/notes/uyc7zM5lyRzHIsmnsSkFT">Iterator</a></p>
<p>Cursors are used to process individual rows returned by database system queries</p>
<p>a cursor makes it possible to define a result set and perform complex logic on it, on a row by row basis</p>
