<ul>
<li>Generally, port triggering is used when the user needs to use port forwarding to reach multiple local computers. 
<ul>
<li>port triggering is also used when applications need to open incoming ports that are different from the outgoing port.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Port triggering is used by network administrators to map a port or ports to one local computer. 
<ul>
<li>Port triggering is considered to be dynamic because ports are opened when they are needed and closed when they arenâ€™t in use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When using port triggering, the router is used to monitor traffic within the network. The user specifies a trigger port that sends outbound data. The router then logs the IP address of computers that have sent traffic to that port. The router then opens an incoming port or ports before forwarding the traffic to that location.</li>
