<p>a <code>check constraint</code> is like a column constraint, except that it's on a table.</p>
<p>Although the end result may be the same, there are some differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>check constraints have to be named and belong to the table, while a NOT NULL column is just an option of the latter</li>
<li>from a performance point of view, creating an explicit not-null constraint is more efficient.
<ul>
<li>only 0.5% performance penalty, so hardly noticeable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you have to remove check constraints before removing the associated columns</li>
<li>a <code>NOT NULL</code> is written beside the column name when issuing <code>\d your_table</code> on psql, while check constraints are described below a specific session</li>
</ul>
