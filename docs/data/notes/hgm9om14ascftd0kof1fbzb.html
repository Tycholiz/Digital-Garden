<p>Data is passed from one layer to the next in what's called a <strong>Feedforward neural network (FNN)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>so-called because connections between the nodes do not form a cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other types of Neural Network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> are commonly used as the model architecture in image classification tasks</li>
<li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong> are commonly used in natural language processing tasks</li>
<li><strong>Transformer</strong> are commonly used in natural language and speech</li>
<li><strong>Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)</strong></li>
</ul>
