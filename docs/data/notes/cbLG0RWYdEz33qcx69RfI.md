### Runner
A runner is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed
- meaning we could use the managed service from Github, or self-host the Runner.

A runner listens for available jobs, runs one job at a time, and reports the progress, logs, and results back to GitHub

GitHub-hosted runners are based on Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS
