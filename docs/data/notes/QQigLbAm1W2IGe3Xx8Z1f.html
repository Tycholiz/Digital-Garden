<p>A state machine is a directed graph where nodes represent all possible states of a view or of the whole app, and where edges represent possible transitions between the states.</p>
<p>State machines are particularly useful when the state is very complex and involves multiple transitions.</p>

<p>An arrow between two nodes means that itâ€™s possible to go through one state to another via some action. All non-listed transitions are not possible. There can be a meaningful transition from a state to the same state that is marked by a circular arrow.</p>
<p>Here is a state machine for the storage of fetched data that is to be stored in the browser
<img src="/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-10-27-09-56-33.png"></p>
<p>There are four states:</p>
<ul>
<li>empty - fetching has not started yet or has been canceled</li>
<li>loading - fetching is in progress</li>
<li>withData - fetching was successful</li>
<li>error - fetching failed</li>
</ul>
