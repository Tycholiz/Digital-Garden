Data is passed from one layer to the next in what's called a **Feedforward neural network (FNN)** 
- so-called because connections between the nodes do not form a cycle.

Other types of Neural Network:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are commonly used as the model architecture in image classification tasks
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are commonly used in natural language processing tasks
- **Transformer** are commonly used in natural language and speech
- **Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)**
