<p>A runner is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed</p>
<ul>
<li>meaning we could use the managed service from Github, or self-host the Runner.</li>
</ul>
<p>A runner listens for available jobs, runs one job at a time, and reports the progress, logs, and results back to GitHub</p>
<p>GitHub-hosted runners are based on Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS</p>
