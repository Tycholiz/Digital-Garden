<p>Shadow DOM is a tool used to build component-based apps and websites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadow DOM comes in small pieces, and it doesn’t represent the whole DOM</li>
<li>Therefore, it can be seen as a subtree or as a separate DOM for an element.</li>
</ul>
<p>The shadow DOM is mostly used when building without a front-end framework.</p>

<p>The DOM and Shadow DOM differ in how they are created and how they behave.</p>
<ul>
<li>DOM nodes are placed within other elements.</li>
<li>Shadow DOM node (a scoped tree) is connected to the element but separated from the children elements
<ul>
<li>the element it's attached to is called a Shadow Host.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything that is added to the Shadow DOM is local, including styles.</p>
<p>If you have an element in the shadow dom and run <code>document.querySelector</code> to find it, it will not be returned.</p>
<p>If we are using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a>, then we are using the shadow DOM.</p>
<hr>
<p>The shadow DOM API is part of the browser specification, supported by most browser versions post 2018.</p>
<p>Shadow DOM should not be confused with the virtual DOM, which is an implementation used in frameworks like React and Vue.</p>
<p>Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular DOM tree — this shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, underneath which can be attached to any elements you want, in the same way as the normal DOM.</p>
