### Hosting
- [Render](https://render.com)
    - *"If Heroku and Netlify had a baby, it would be Render.com" -Scott Tolinski*
- [Begin](https://begin.com)
- [Netlify: for static apps](https://netlify.com)
    - plain html or generated with create-react-app or gatsby. It provides a good, fast CDN that is pretty easy to use.
    - Netlify typically gets used for pure-frontend (it now supports serverless functions too)

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
    - for dynamic apps like the ones generated with Next.js
    - with Vercel you can deploy your API next to your frontend (assuming you're using Next.js).
