<p>purity and immutability between components is critical. mutability within a component is fine.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. pushing onto an array within a component is fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>When React is interpreting JSX, it will treat custom components (<code>&#x3C;Form></code>) as recursive functions, and regular elements (<code>&#x3C;form></code>) as the finality of the chain</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. We say "React, render a <code>&#x3C;Sidebar></code> for me". React responds "ok what's in a <code>&#x3C;Sidebar></code>?", and it will go on like this until React gets to the html elements and it has therefore built up the entire component tree.</li>
</ul>

<p>Higher-Order Components are generic functions, as they only care about the argument being a component. The type of the componentâ€™s properties is not important.</p>
