<p>A data warehouse is a database optimized to analyze relational data coming from transactional systems and line of business applications.</p>
<p>The data structure, and schema are defined in advance to optimize for fast SQL queries, where the results are typically used for operational reporting and analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is cleaned, enriched, and transformed so it can act as the “single source of truth” that users can trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>It differs from a <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/wywXc6giwBv8xoiEMJlJW">data lake</a> because it stores the data in a single format, whereas a data lake stores the data as-is (Postgres, Mongo etc.)</p>
