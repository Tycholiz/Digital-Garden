<ul>
<li>def - a HOC that memoizes the rendered output of a component</li>
<li><code>Memo</code> accepts a second arg that lets us determine whether or not the component should re-render (defaults to <code>true</code>, meaning it won't re-render)</li>
<li>When deciding to update DOM, React first renders your component, then compares the result with the previous render result. If the render results are different, React updates the DOM.
<ul>
<li>To be clear, React will always render, but won't always update DOM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When we wrap our component with <code>Memo</code>, the first render will be memoized. Every subsequent render will involve the usual check of oldProps/oldState vs nextProps/nextState, but instead of rendering the component <em>then</em> comparing the output to the DOM, it will just take the memoized output. The logic is: since props or state didn't change, we shouldn't need to re-render it (which may well be the case for some components; in which circumstance we should certainly wrap the component with <code>Memo</code></li>
<li>Components using hooks can be freely wrapped in React.memo() to achieve memoization</li>
<li>use mostly when component trees get too wide or too deep</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>the component is purely functional (if class, use PureComponent and modify SCU), and given same props, will always return the same component</li>
<li>the component renders often
<ul>
<li>often what causes this is a Parent with state/props that change often, and a Child who would receive the same props for a longer period of time. In this case, memoize the Child
<ul>
<li>ex. we have a <code>&#x3C;MoviePage /></code> component and inside it a <code>&#x3C;MovieInfo title={props.title} /></code>. MoviePage holds the state to determine how many thumbs up a movie has, and it pings the server every second. Therefore, when the number changes, the component re-renders, and thereby forces MovieInfo to render. The issue here is that <code>props.title</code> is not going to change each time, so React is needlessly rendering the component each time. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the component often receives the same props in between renders</li>
<li>the component contains a decent amount of components that are subject to conditional rendering (and depend on a prop)</li>
</ol>
