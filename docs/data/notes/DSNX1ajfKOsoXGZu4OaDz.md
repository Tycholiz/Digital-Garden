# Atlas
- the cloud-based database-as-a-service (DBaaS) of Mongo. Basically, this solution lets Mongo take care of all the deployment details. The MongoDB instance is hosted on their servers, and we just need to use those servers, and pay a service charge for doing so. This is an alternative to self-hosting those MongoDB instances and taking care of all of those details yourself.
	- This is comparable to how Firebase works. You delegate your having to create a backend to Firebase, meaning Google will host your servers, and all you need to do is communicate with them.
- Atlas will use a cloud-provider, like AWS, Azure, or Linode
