<ul>
<li>a networked device that broadcasts the same data out of each of its ports and lets each device decide what data they need</li>
<li>since repeaters amplify a signal, they need a source of electric power</li>
<li>Repeaters operate on L1, since they do not try to interpret the data being transmitted</li>
<li>anal. in Lord of the Rings, Gondor has a series of beacons that can be lit to communicate to the whole kingdom that war has been declared. 
<ul>
<li>Therefore, each repeater (beacon) receives a signal and retransmits it (by lighting up their own beacon)</li>
</ul>
