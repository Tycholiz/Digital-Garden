If a language treats functions as first-class citizens, it means we can treat it like we do other entities (ie. variables).
- That is, we can assign the function to a variable, we can pass the function as an argument to another function, we can return a function from another function etc.

In languages such as these, the names of the functions have no special status. They are treated as ordinary variables with a `function` type.
