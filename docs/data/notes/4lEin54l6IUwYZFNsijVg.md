Trees are relation-based data structure, which specialize in representing hierarchical structures.

Like a [[linked list|general.lang.data-structs.linked-list]], nodes contain both elements of data and pointers marking its relation to immediate nodes.
- This means that a BST is a linked data structure.

For a graph to be a tree, we must be able to take any 2 nodes and be able to draw exactly *one* path between them.

almost every operation you'll do with trees is implemented most easily with recursion

trees usually work in `O(log n)`
