<ul>
<li>P2P networks works don't have a server, which would provide centralized coordination in a traditional client-server model Instead, it is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers</li>
<li>Each peer has equal privileges and each has equal power.</li>
<li>each peer designates a porion of their resources as available for consumption by other nodes in the network. 
<ul>
<li>ex. can share resources like processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided. Put another way, each node acts as both a client and a server.</li>
<li>P2P networks implement an overlay network, whose nodes are a subset of the nodes found in the physical network.</li>
<li>data is still exchanged over TCP/IP, but P2P nodes can communicate directly at L7 by using the logical overlay links (each logical overlay link corresponds to a physical link of the underlying network.)</li>
<li>ex. WiFi Direct, Skype</li>
<li>Because there is no server, other strategies must be taken to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be handled by the server, such as login
<ul>
<li>To carry out login duties, a P2P network has what's called a Login Server</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>P2P networks became popular with Napster, because the more traditional way to use the internet is more heavily regulated and corporately-owned. This means that Napster could skirt a lot of the authorities on the matter. </li>
