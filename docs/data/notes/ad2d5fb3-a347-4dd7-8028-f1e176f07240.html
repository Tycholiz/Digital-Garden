<ul>
<li>Networks enable containers to be able to communicate with each other and with non-Docker processes (such as a host) </li>
<li>Networks are natural ways to isolate containers from other containers or other networks. As such, they provide complete isolation for containers</li>
<li>Dockerâ€™s networking subsystem is pluggable, made possible by having drivers
<ul>
<li>depending on which driver you are using, you will have different core networking functionality </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>docker network ls</code> - show all networks</li>
<li>all containers within a network can communicate with each other. This can be shown by the fact that you can ping the IP address of one container from another (within the same network) 
<ul>
<li>you can also simply <code>ping &#x3C;container-name></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docker networking allows you to attach a container to as many networks as you like.</li>
<li>to see if 2 containers are properly on the same network, try pinging one container's IP from another.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 2 main types of network: bridge and overlay</p>
<h2 id="bridge"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#bridge"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Bridge</h2>
<ul>
<li>this is the default
<ul>
<li>Docker creates a bridge named <code>docker0</code>, and both the docker host and the docker containers have an IP address on that bridge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bridge networks are usually used when your applications run in standalone containers that need to communicate over the same docker host (ex. a pod?)</li>
<li>Limited to a single host running Docker Engine.</li>
<li>default type</li>
<li>if our <code>docker-compose.yml</code> does not explicitly specify a network to use, a special network called <em>bridge</em> will be the network that our containers are launched in 
<ul>
<li>visible with <code>docker network ls</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overlay"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#overlay"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Overlay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together and enable swarm services to communicate with each other.</li>
<li>can include multiple hosts and is a more advanced configuration</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="host-network"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#host-network"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Host network</h2>
<ul>
<li>if we have a standalone container, network isolation between the container and the Docker host will be removed, and the container will use the host's network directly</li>
<li>host is only available for swarm services</li>
</ul>
