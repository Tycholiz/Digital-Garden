When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters, itâ€™s called Overloading.
- This is distinct from `Overriding` which is when we have a method in the child class and a method in the parent class, and they both have the same name. In this case, the method defined in the child would override the parent's version.

Overloading implements Compile time polymorphism
