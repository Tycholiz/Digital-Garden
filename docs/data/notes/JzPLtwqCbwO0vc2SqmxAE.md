AWS Step Functions is a low-code way to implement event-driven workflows that connect services, systems or people.
- We can do this with Workflow Studio, giving us a drag and drop interface.

Any AWS service can be used in the steps of the workflow.

Step Functions manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you to make sure that your workflows run in order and as expected.

Step Functions offers two workflow types- Standard or Express- that can be used depending on your specific use case.
- Standard Workflows are used to manage long-running workloads.
- Express Workflows support high-volume event processing workloads.

Can be used for:
- building distributed applications
- automating IT and business processes
- build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services

Failures, retries, parallelization, service integrations, and observability are all handled out of the box for us, allowing us to focus on high-level business logic.
