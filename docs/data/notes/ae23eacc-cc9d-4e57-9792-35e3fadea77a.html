<p>Apple events are a high-level message-based form of Interprocess Communication (IPC), used to communicate between local or remote application processes</p>
<p>An Apple Event contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attributes describing how the event should be handled</li>
<li>optional parameters to the event handler that receives the event</li>
</ol>
<p>Example</p>
<ul>
<li>When we drag-n-drop a file onto the TextEdit.app icon in Finder, what happens is that Finder commands TextEdit to open that file by sending it an <code>odoc</code> (open doc) event with a list of file identifiers as its parameter

</ul>
<p>With proper bindings, Apple events can be created and sent with programming languages</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. from our client application, we might call <code>iTunes().play()</code>, causing a hook/Play event to be sent from the client application to iTunes, instructing it to start playing. Applications may respond to an incoming Apple event by sending a reply event back to the client application</li>
</ul>

<p>The AEOM is a view-controller layer that provides a user-friendly representation of the application's internal data, allowing clients to identify and manipulate parts of that structure via Apple events</p>
<ul>
<li>An incoming Apple event representing a particular command (get, set, move, etc.) is unpacked, and any object specifiers in its parameter list are evaluated against the application's AEOM to identify the user-level object(s) upon which the command should act</li>
<li>The command is then applied these objects, with the AEOM translating this into operations upon the application's implementation-level objects
<ul>
<li>These implementation-level objects are mostly user-data objects in the application's Model layer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-05-07-09-57-56.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>The AEOM represents user data as a tree-shaped object graph, whose nodes are connected via 1:1 and/or 1:many relationships.</li>
<li>AEOM objects are identified by high-level queries (comparable to XPath or CSS selectors), not low-level chained method calls.</li>
<li>While the Apple Event Object Model is sometimes described by third-parties as being similar to DOM, this is inaccurate as AEOM operates at a much higher level of abstraction than DOM.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AEOM is a tree-like structure made up of objects. These objects may contain descriptive attributes such as class, name, id, size, or bounds; for example:</p>
<pre><code>finder.version
itunes.playerState
textedit.frontmost
finder.home
textedit.documents
itunes.playlists
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike other object models such as DOM, objects within the AEOM are associated with one another by relationships rather than simple physical containment
Relationships between objects may be one-to-one:</p>
<pre><code>finder.home
itunes.currentTrack
</code></pre>
<p>or one-to-many:</p>
<pre><code>finder.folders
itunes.playlists
</code></pre>
<p>to show how how this tree-like structure is not related to containment (as the DOM is), consider that the following object specifiers all identify the same objects (files on the user's desktop):</p>
<ul>
<li>the first specifier describes the files' location by physical containment; the other two use other relationships provided by the application as convenient shortcuts</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>finder.disks["Macintosh HD"].folders["Users"].folders["kyletycholiz"].folders["Desktop"].files

finder.desktop.files

finder.files
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the AEOM for a simple hypothetical text editor:
