<p>A DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network. </p>
<ul>
<li>Its purpose is to carry data between processes in order to reduce the number of method calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DTO is used to encapsulate data we send from one endpoint to another. Use DTO to define interfaces for input and output for endpoints in your system</p>
<p>When we are working inter-process, each call is expensive. As a result, we want to pack more data in each call.</p>
<ul>
<li>we could accomplish this by adding many parameters, but this gets unwieldly fast.</li>
<li>instead, we can create a DTO to hold all of the data for the call.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually an assembler is used on the server side to transfer data between the DTO and any domain objects.</p>
<p>DTOs are normally implemented as POJOs, and are flat data structures that contain no business logic. </p>
