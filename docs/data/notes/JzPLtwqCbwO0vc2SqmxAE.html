<p>AWS Step Functions is a low-code way to implement event-driven workflows that connect services, systems or people.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can do this with Workflow Studio, giving us a drag and drop interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any AWS service can be used in the steps of the workflow.</p>
<p>Step Functions manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you to make sure that your workflows run in order and as expected.</p>
<p>Step Functions offers two workflow types- Standard or Express- that can be used depending on your specific use case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Workflows are used to manage long-running workloads.</li>
<li>Express Workflows support high-volume event processing workloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>building distributed applications</li>
<li>automating IT and business processes</li>
<li>build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services</li>
</ul>
<p>Failures, retries, parallelization, service integrations, and observability are all handled out of the box for us, allowing us to focus on high-level business logic.</p>
