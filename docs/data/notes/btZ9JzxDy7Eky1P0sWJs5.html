<p>A mesh is the main graphics primitive in Unity, and make up a large part of the 3D world</p>
<ul>
<li>meshes turn into pixels that look like real objects</li>
<li>meshes can be made from either triangular or quadrangular polygons
A mesh consists of triangles arranged in 3D space to create the impression of a solid object.</li>
<li>A triangle is defined by its three corner points or vertices (stored in a single array of integers; understood as each group of 3 belonging to a single vertex) &#x3C;- so elements 0, 1 and 2 define the first triangle, 3, 4 and 5 define the second, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Skyboxes are rendered around the whole scene in order to give the impression of complex scenery at the horizon.
Internally skyboxes are rendered after all opaque objects</p>
