<p>Minikube commands are almost exactly the same as those from Docker Machine which, on the other hand, are similar to those from Vagrant.</p>
<p><code>minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox</code></p>
<ul>
<li>creates a new VM based on the Minikube image, and deploys the necessary Kubernetes components into it.</li>
<li>The VM will get configured with Docker and Kubernetes via a single binary called <em>localkube</em>.</li>
<li>This image includes several binaries, including Docker engine</li>
<li>after creating a new VM, we'll need to connect the docker client to the docker server with <code>eval $(minikube docker-env)</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>minikube dashboard</code></p>
<ul>
<li>open a browser-based UI</li>
</ul>
<p><code>minikube docker-env</code></p>
<ul>
<li>output the docker environment variables to console</li>
<li>these env variables are relevant for the docker engine running in the image</li>
</ul>
<p><code>minikube stop</code></p>
<ul>
<li>stop the cluster, but preserve cluster state and data</li>
</ul>
