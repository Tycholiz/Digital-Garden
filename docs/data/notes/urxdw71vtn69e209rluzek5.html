<p>A Scheduler lets you define in what execution context will an Observable deliver notifications to its Observer.</p>
<p>A scheduler controls when a subscription starts and when notifications are delivered. It consists of three components.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Scheduler is a data structure. It knows how to store and queue tasks based on priority or other criteria.</li>
<li>A Scheduler is an execution context. It denotes where and when the task is executed (e.g. immediately, or in another callback mechanism such as setTimeout or process.nextTick, or the animation frame).</li>
<li>A Scheduler has a (virtual) clock. It provides a notion of "time" by a getter method now() on the scheduler. Tasks being scheduled on a particular scheduler will adhere only to the time denoted by that clock.</li>
</ol>
