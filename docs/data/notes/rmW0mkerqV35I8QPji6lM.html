<p>The purpose of presenting is not to explain the concept. Rather, it is to get the audience excited about whatever it is you are talking about. The fact that there are other people in the audience is key. The energy of the audience helps to sell your concept. As a result of this, a presentation should be full of stories. It's not an expose on what you're presenting.</p>
