<p>If <a href="/notes/zv00g97iw4ngvv7pht794rd">inheritance</a> is about <em>being</em> another class/interface, composition is about <em>using</em> one.</p>
<p>when a Field’s type is a class, the field will hold a reference to another object, thus creating an association relationship between them. Let’s intuitively define composition as when the class uses another object to provide some or all of its functionality.</p>
