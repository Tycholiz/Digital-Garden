# Lexical scope
- def - scope that is determined by the JS engine before any code has even been executed (ie. it only looks at the source codeâ€” known as [lexing time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis))
- when you see lexical, think "static"
- lexical scoping is analogous to prototypical inheritance, in a sense that the engine will walk up the chain to find a variable, if one is not found in the local scope.

blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and so on should ideally be one line long. If that is unachievable, then it should be striven for to have all code at a single level of indentation.
