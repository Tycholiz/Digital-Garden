<p>a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>the purpose is to establish a barrier between a trusted and an untrusted network</li>
</ul>
<p>Firewalls are either network-based (e.g. <a href="/notes/N9mY1iHMSznlRnVANB9Ip">LAN</a>) or host-based</p>
<ul>
<li>Network-based firewalls are positioned between two or more networks (e.g. between LAN and WAN)</li>
<li>Host-based firewalls are deployed directly on the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources.</li>
</ul>
