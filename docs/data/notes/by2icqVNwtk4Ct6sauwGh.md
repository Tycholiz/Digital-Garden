With a 3D modeling software like Blender, artists model the shape of a 3D object, **rig** it so that it can be animated, **animate** it to move in a particular way, and **texture** it to give it color and shading. An example of this is shown below.

Unity has a quick n' dirty implementation of a 3D modeler called [ProBuilder](https://unity.com/features/probuilder)
