<p>RxJS can be used with React to implement streams as state. That is, we use RxJS streams as our application state.</p>
<ul>
<li>a stream represents events or changing values over time. This can be represented as state in React. </li>
</ul>
<p>React is a <a href="/notes/D8Z3rjXkSj2EOymXQXF4Z#push-vs-pull-data-creation1">pull-first system</a>, while RxJS is push-first. By making React push-first, we gain several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance: only those entities that depend on the value that has changed will update, and it can be done without having to make comparisons or detect changes.</li>
<li>state management becomes more declarative, in a way that can be read top-to-bottom.</li>
</ul>
