a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- the purpose is to establish a barrier between a trusted and an untrusted network

Firewalls are either network-based (e.g. [[LAN|network.lan]]) or host-based
- Network-based firewalls are positioned between two or more networks (e.g. between LAN and WAN)
- Host-based firewalls are deployed directly on the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources.
