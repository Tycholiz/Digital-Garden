<p><em>"BDD is an outside-in, pull-based, multiple-stakeholder, multiple-scale, high-automation, agile methodology. It describes a cycle of interactions with well-defined outputs, resulting in the delivery of working, tested software that matters."</em></p>
<p><em>"It's using examples to talk through how an application behaves... And having conversations about those examples."</em></p>
<h3 id="approach">Approach<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#approach"></a></h3>
<p>The BDD process encourages collaboration among: </p>
<ul>
<li>developers</li>
<li>quality assurance testers</li>
<li>customer representatives in a software project</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done through inter-team conversation and using concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave</p>
<p>BDD suggests a specific way that unit tests and acceptance tests should be written:</p>
<ul>
<li>unit test names be whole sentences starting with a conditional verb ("should" in English for example) and should be written in order of business value.
<ul>
<li>ex. all other music players should pause when pressing play on a music player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>acceptance tests should be written in the form of a user story ("Being a <code>[role/actor/stakeholder]</code> I want to <code>[feature/capability]</code> so I can <code>[benefit]</code>")</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bdd-focuses-on">BDD Focuses on:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#bdd-focuses-on"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Where to start in the process</li>
<li>What to test and what not to test</li>
<li>How much to test in one go</li>
<li>What to call the tests</li>
<li>How to understand why a test fails</li>
</ul>
<p>BDD emerged from <a href="/notes/oVfbIz9jQKACNE2FyfskO">TDD</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The general techniques and principles of TDD are preserved in BDD,</li>
<li>further incorporated are ideas from <a href="/notes/GDJoTJocO8OKbTtSjn2CW">DDD</a> and <a href="/notes/12a2891c-e26b-47db-9e2e-7a3de90b672b">OOP</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-bdd-results-in">Implementing BDD Results in:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implementing-bdd-results-in"></a></h3>
<p>The result is that software development and other stakeholders (management teams, designers, PMs etc.) now have shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.</p>
<p>To properly implement BDD, special software tools have to be used to ease this collaboration amongst teams.</p>
