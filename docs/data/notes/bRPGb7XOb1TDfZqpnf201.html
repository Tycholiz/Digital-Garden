<p>Kubelet is the Kubernetes Node Agent, and it communicates with the control plane and is responsible for starting and running container scheduled in that node.</p>
<p>Kubelet runs on each node. Its primary function is to make sure that assigned pods are running on the node.</p>
<ul>
<li>It watches for any new Pod assignments for the node. If a Pod is assigned to the node Kubelet is running on, it will pull the Pod definition and use it to create containers through Docker or any other supported container engine.</li>
</ul>
