<p>Hooks are a type of function that allows your system to call some other module.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a broad way to describe this pattern where some piece of code (the hook) can trigger in response to data being sent between software components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ex. keylogging</p>
<ul>
<li>Basically, our application code says "ok System, I want to be notified anytime anytime a user presses a key"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ex. Every Chrome (or other browser) extension is possible because of hooks in the browser.</p>
<ul>
<li>The extension sets up a hook to be notified when a specific page is navigated to.</li>
<li>Vimium executes hooks in response to keypresses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ex. Video games with mod support are another example of hooks in action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ex. a browser might use a hook to make it easier for antivirus software to scan downloads.</p>
<ul>
<li>When it starts a download, it shouts "Hey, anyone listening, I'm starting a download!", and any program listening for that will be able to react and intervene.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A screen reader for blind users sets up a system hook to know when another program creates a new window on the screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were to try and implement this mod to the game, you could use a hook provided by the game itself. Essentially, when an event happens in the game (ie. when bullets are shot), a hook is executed, which turns the resulting bullet holes colored.</p>
