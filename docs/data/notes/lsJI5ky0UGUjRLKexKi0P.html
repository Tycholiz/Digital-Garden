<p>C Preprocessors are the header of the file</p>
<ul>
<li>contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.
<ul>
<li>In essence, they are like importing modules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ex. <code>stdio.h</code> – Defines core input and output functions</li>
<li>In C, all lines that start with # are processed by preprocessor which is a program invoked by the compiler
<ul>
<li>a preprocessor takes a C program and produces another C program without any <code>#</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When we use <code>include</code> directive,  the contents of included header file (after preprocessing) are copied to the current file.
<ul>
<li><code>&#x3C;</code> and <code>></code> instruct the preprocessor to look in the standard folder</li>
<li><code>“</code> and <code>“</code> instruct the preprocessor to look into the current folder</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When we use <code>define</code> for a constant, the preprocessor produces a C program where the defined constant is searched and matching tokens are replaced with the given expression
<ul>
<li>ex. <code>#define max 100</code> — <code>max</code> is searched for in the program, and is replaced with <code>100</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
