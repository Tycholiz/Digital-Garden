<p>A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) defines a new resource type, and tells Kubernetes about it</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a new resource type is added, new instances of that resource may be created.</li>
</ul>
<p>Handling CRD changes is up to us as the developer, though a common pattern is to create a custom controller that watches for new CRD instances, and responds accordingly.</p>
