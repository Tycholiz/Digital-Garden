<p>Allow us to record and number of keystrokes into a register</p>
<ul>
<li>ideal for repeating changes over a set of similar lines, paragraphs and files.</li>
<li>macros allow us to easily append commands to the end of an existing one
<ul>
<li>for complex ones, we can paste the macro into a document, edit it, then yank it back into the register</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>golden rule - ensure every command in a macro is repeatable</li>
<li>before starting to record a macro, ask: where am I, where did I come from, where am I going?
<ul>
<li>before doing anything make sure the cursor is positioned to the next command does as we'd expect, and where we'd expect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>any motions that fail cause the macro to fail.
<ul>
<li>ex. - pressing <code>k</code> on line 1 does nothing, so it would fail if we tried.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>@@</code> - repeat last macro</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are making a macro, imagine you are looping a piece of paper back onto itself. The edge you start at must touch the edge you finish at. This is the same concept as making macros: After identifying a repetitive action, define the start point of a single action, start recording and do the stuff, then finish the macro when you are at the start of the next action.</p>
<h2 id="tips">Tips<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tips"></a></h2>
<p>When using macros to perform a repetitive action on multiple lines, it's a good idea to make the first action to move our cursor to the starting position (ie. the edge in the paper loop analogy)</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. we can start with <code>0</code> to go to the start of the line</li>
</ul>
