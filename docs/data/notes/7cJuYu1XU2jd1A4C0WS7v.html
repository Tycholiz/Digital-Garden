<p>When using a service, requests to one of the exposed ports will be picked up by Kube DNS and forwarded to one of the pods.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. as a user, I can access the exposed port (ie. <strong>27017</strong>:34172) through any node of the cluster. Kube DNS is the component that picks up those requests and forwards them on.</li>
</ul>
