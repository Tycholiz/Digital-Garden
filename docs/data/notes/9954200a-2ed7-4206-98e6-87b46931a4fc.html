<p>Ingress objects manage external access to the applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<ul>
<li>it may seem that this use-case is already solved by <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/cac281fe-198d-48ad-b011-2da1928931ca">services</a>, but services don't make applications truly accessible, because we still need forwarding rules based on paths and domains, SSL termination and a number of other features.</li>
<li>in a more traditional setup, weâ€™d probably use an external proxy and a load balancer. Ingress provides an API that allows us to accomplish these things, in addition to a few other features we expect from a dynamic cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ingresses act as traffic cop, routing traffic from outside the cluster into destination points within the cluster.</p>
<ul>
<li>One single external ingress point can accept traffic destined to many different internal services.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Ingress, we can configure an external load balancer directly from Kubernetes</p>
