<p>While inner and outer joins involve starting with one table and appending rows onto it, CROSS JOINs involve taking 2+ tables and generating a cartesian coordinate table as a result of it.

<p>Effectively, this gives us a combination of each row in T1 and T2</p>
<ul>
<li>In the above image, T1 has 3 rows and T2 has 3 rows, so the result set of the CROSS JOIN has 9 (3 * 3) rows</li>
</ul>
