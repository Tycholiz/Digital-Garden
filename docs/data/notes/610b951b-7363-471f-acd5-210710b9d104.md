An api is really an interesting thing, because it allows you to do the work once, and have its effect (result) be replicated ad infinitum. Consider the way the cursor works in WoW. The cursor points over something, and somehow it knows what it is hovering over. Well, For a mouse to able to locate something in that sense, it has to have the coordinates of the item (ex. a chest). If the coordinates that you are hovering over match the coordinates of the chest, then you know you are hovering over the chest. The function to determine this is complex, but it is at the end of the day reducible to a function. We can still walk away with an atomic piece that can be transported anywhere. So imagine we take the functionality of determining where the coorinate of the cursor is and wrap it up into a function. Now all we need to do is run that function every time the mouse moves. We have just created an API that easily replicable across the entire application.
