As a skilled guitarist, you might watch a 10 minute video and walk away with,
> “Ah, so one major pentatonic scale cannot be applied universally to a chord progression. To sound good I have to match the scale to the specific chord being played.

What if you jump into learning about AWS before learning the periphery concepts first? You will never learn this way, because knowledge builds on top of other knowledge.

To understand... 
- PassportJS - you need to know how auth works, how sessions works, or how/what OAuth is
- Docker - you need to know what a virtual machine was or why it is useful, otherwise you won't understand containers.
- AWS - you need to understand what “cloud architecture” so, otherwise you can't understand what it meant to deploy code in the cloud.
- HTML template engines - you need to understand browsers, http, servers, databases, and client-side vs server-side rendering
