<p>A relation is a set of tuples (fixed length array)</p>
<ul>
<li>in other words, a single row in a single database is a relation between all the values that represent that row</li>
<li>in SQL, a relation is represented by a table, with each row being a tuple</li>
<li>a tuple is described as a function, since it maps names to values.
<ul>
<li>ex. for row 1, name -> "Kyle"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>each element (cell) of the tuple is termed an <code>attribute value</code>
<ul>
<li>an attribute is the combination of the column name and its type
<ul>
<li>ex. age int</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an attribute value is the cross-section of an attribute and a tuple (ie. it is a single piece of data)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>each SQL clause will transform one or several relations in order to produce new relations.</li>
<li>Data is not relational. Rather, data has relationships.</li>
<li><em>relational</em> is the concept that we have a set of elements that all share the same properties (aka attribute domains)
<ul>
<li>ex. if we have a table <code>foo</code> with 2 columns: id: int and name: text, then every single record in this database will look exactly like that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
