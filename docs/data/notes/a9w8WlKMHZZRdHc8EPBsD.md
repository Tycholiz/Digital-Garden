A Container is an instance of an [[Image|docker.image]]

Containers decouple the machine's OS from the application dependencies and the code.
- Each container had its own filesystem (provided by a Docker image)
- Image includes everything needed to run an application
    - inc. the application code, runtimes, dependencies etc
- Containers are designed to be transient and temporary, but they can be stopped and restarted, which launches the container into the same state as when it was stopped.
- Containers can communicate with each other by attaching (`docker attach`). They do this by attaching stdin, stdout and stderr steams to one another so that one container's output can be piped into another container as their input 
	- When we run `docker attach` with a specified container, we are piping our stdin/stdout/stderr to the container, so we are effectively able to write commands in the container's terminal

containers can be created from any point in an imageâ€™s history, much like source control.

## From the container's perspective 
The container by default has no access to the outside world. When the docker host specifies the `-p` option when spinning up a new container, the container opens up the specified ports and maps them to the docker host's port.
- For all the container knows, it is a regular computer. It has a network interface, including an IP address, a gateway, a routing table etc.

- Containers guarantee our applications will run the same anywhere, whether it's our own machine, a data centre, or anything else

## Run container
`docker run --name *<NAME OF CONTAINER>* -d -v /tmp/mongodb:/data/db -p 27017:27017 *<NAME OF IMAGE:IMAGE TAG>*`
- `--name`: Name of the container.
- `-v`: Attach the /tmp/mongodb volume of the host system to /data/db volume of the container.
- `-p`: Map the host port to the container port.
Last argument is the name/id of the image.

## Running commands in the container
- we can use `docker exec` to run commands.
- by default, the command is executed in the WORKDIR variable that is declared in the Dockerfile
- often, we see `docker exec -it <containerID> /bin/bash`
	- this executes the command `/bin/bash` within the specified container, opening a new bash session for us.
	- `-t` tells docker to open a terminal session
	- `-i` for interactive, ensures that our stdin input stream remains open 

## Stopping container
- `docker stop`: Send SIGTERM(termination signal), and if needed SIGKILL(kill signal)
	- use when you wish to clear up memory or delete all of the processes' -cached- data. Simply put, you no longer care about the processes in the container and are comfortable with killing them.
- `docker pause`: Send SIGSTOP(pause signal)
	- use when you only want to suspend the processes in the container; you do not want them to lose data or state.

## Actions
- get IP of container - `docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <my-container-name>`
