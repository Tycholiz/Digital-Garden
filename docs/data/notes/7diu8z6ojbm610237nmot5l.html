<p>Schema Registry provides a centralized repository for managing and validating schemas for topic messages</p>
<ul>
<li>It also provides a versioning mechanism so we can update the schema as needed.</li>
<li>prior to interacting with the topic, the producer and consumer can each retrieve the latest version of the schema and validate their data against it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schema Registry also defines the format of the serialized data and is used to validate the data as it is being deserialized by another system or application</p>
<ul>
<li>That is, it is Schema Registry that knows if you serialized your Kafka messages with Avro, <a href="/notes/74lYtC8NKpCzcyFOZTfR1">JSON Schema</a> or Protobuf.</li>
</ul>
