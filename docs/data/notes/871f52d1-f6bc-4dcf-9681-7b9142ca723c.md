# Backups
- 3-2-1 rule of backups: 3 copies, 2+ formats, at least one copy offsite.
- If something is built into a software workflow, then it is not a backup
	- ex. Joplin sync does not count as backup, nor does Mackup. The reason is that we interact with these tools in a dynmaic way. We don't treat them as immutable snapshots. A backup is only a backup if it's immutable (or treated as such).
- If you haven't yet tried to restore all of your data via your backup file, then you don't have a backup system in place.
