<p>or simply <code>:G</code>

<ul>
<li>can use visual mode</li>
</ul>
<p><code>p</code> - run <code>git add --patch</code> for the file under cursor</p>
<ul>
<li>splits file into hunks of changes and allows you to pick which parts to stage for commit</li>
<li>not as useful, since we can just use <code>diffget</code> as described below.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>cc</code> - commit
<code>D</code> - open file under cursor as a diff
<code>U</code> - unstage a file ("I've staged a file and want to remove it from the index")
<code>X</code> - untrack a file ("I've changed a file in the working tree and want to discard all changes")</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>:Gw[rite]</code> - write (save) the current file and stage it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>:Gr[ead]</code> - read the index version of the file into the current buffer</p>
<ul>
<li>good for seeing what changes were made (that haven't been staged yet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Gwrite</code> and <code>Gread</code> are opposites. Running <code>Gread</code> in the working file will do the exact same thing as running <code>Gwrite</code> in the index file +vv (both cause the working copy to revert to the index version)</p>
<ul>
<li>Both of these commands reconcile differences between the working copy and
the index version of a file by overwriting the contents of one buffer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can be more granular with our reconciliation by using vim built-in <code>diffget</code>/<code>diffput</code> (alias <code>do</code>/<code>dp</code>, respectively. These aliases also run :diffupdate afterwards, to fix coloring issues)</p>
<ul>
<li>While running <code>:Gdiff</code>, if we are in the index window and position the
cursor over a hunk of text and run <code>diffget</code>, it will pull that hunk into
the working copy of the file.</li>
<li>If there are changes in the working copy (right side) that you'd like to move to the index, you can visually select those lines and run <code>diffput</code>
<ul>
<li>this opens a new buffer with just the hunks you've added. we need to save this buffer before we `</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>diffget</code> makes changes in the currently active buffer, while <code>diffput</code> makes changes in the inactive buffer (by drawing in differences from the active buffer)
<img src="/assets/images/2021-03-08-21-36-16.png"></li>
<li>run <code>:diffupdate</code> if colors get messed up as a result of doing this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>:Gedit :0</code> - open index version of current file (remember: staging a file
updates the index version of the file (?))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>:Gremove</code> - wipe out the buffer and run <code>git remove</code> on the current file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>:Gmove</code> - rename the current file</p>
<ul>
<li>does a whole bunch more than <code>git move</code>, so it's not a direct replacement</li>
<li>ex. <code>:Gmove new-file-name</code> - (relative to the path of the current file)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>jump between conflicting regions with <code>[c</code>/<code>]c</code></p>

<h2 id="merge-conflicts">Merge conflicts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#merge-conflicts"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>open a file with merge conflicts and run <code>:Gdiff</code>
<ul>
<li>might need to run <code>Gdiffsplit!</code> to get 3 windows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The windows shown are:
<ol>
<li>Target Branch - The branch we are merging into (normally master)</li>
<li>Working Tree - The file as it currently is (with changes visible from both target branch and merge branch)</li>
<li>Merge Branch - The branch we are introducing</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>if using <code>diffget</code> and want to accept changes from the target branch (likely master), run <code>:diffget //2</code>. If we wan to accept changes from merge branch (likely feature-branch), run <code>:diffget //3</code></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="diff">Diff<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#diff"></a></h1>
<p>Left window is the commit we are comparing against, and right window is the current working copy</p>
<h3 id="colors">Colors<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#colors"></a></h3>
<p>red - lines were deleted
green - lines were added
teal - lines were modified</p>
<ul>
<li>knowing colors, we can easily notice if something has actually been removed, or if it was just moved/has a new structure
<ul>
<li>In this case, you'd find the green code in the left hand side, and try and match it up with a green chunk on the righthand side. If we find a match, then we know the code format just changed, and that no actual code was deleted.</li>
