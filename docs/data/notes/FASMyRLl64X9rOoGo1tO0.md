`setInterval` allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

setInterval says "call *this* function (arg1) every X seconds (arg2)

To stop further calls, we should call `clearInterval(timerId)`.

Both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` allow us to execute some code at a later point in time (ie. "schedule a call")
