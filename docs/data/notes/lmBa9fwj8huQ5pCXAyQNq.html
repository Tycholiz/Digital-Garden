<p>A namespace is a virtual cluster that, as the name suggests, serves to create a distinct area within the physical cluster. It allows Kubernetes to manage multiple clusters (which could be multiple different applications (term loosely used) within the same product) in a single physical cluster</p>
<p>Namespaces provide us a way to group and segment pods, rcs, volumes, and secrets</p>
<ul>
<li>A namespace functions as a grouping mechanism inside of Kubernetes. Services, pods, replication controllers,
and volumes can easily cooperate within a namespace, and the namespace provides a degree of isolation from
other parts of the cluster.</li>
</ul>
