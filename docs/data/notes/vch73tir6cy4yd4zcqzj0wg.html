<p>Operators transform one or more <code>DataStreams</code> into a new <code>DataStream</code>.</p>
<h3 id="mapflatmap"><code>map</code>/<code>flatMap</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#mapflatmap"></a></h3>
<p>suitable only when performing a one-to-one transformation: for each and every stream element coming in, <code>map()</code> will emit one transformed element</p>
<ul>
<li>Otherwise, you will want to use <code>flatmap()</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="keyby"><code>keyBy</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#keyby"></a></h3>
<p>Logically partitions a stream.</p>
<ul>
<li>All records with the same key are assigned to the same partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is often very useful to be able to partition a stream around one of its attributes</p>
<ul>
<li>the result is that all events with the same value of that attribute are grouped together.</li>
<li>ex. imagine we had a stream of data for taxi rides, and we wanted to find the longest taxi rides starting in each of the grid cells.
<ul>
<li>if this were a SQL query, this would mean doing some sort of <code>GROUP BY</code> with the startCell, while in Flink this is done with keyBy(KeySelector)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
