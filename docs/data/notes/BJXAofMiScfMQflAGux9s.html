<h3 id="keys">Keys<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#keys"></a></h3>
<p>Try to stick with a schema. For instance <code>object-type:id</code> is a good idea, as in "user:1000". Dots or dashes are often used for multi-word fields, as in <code>comment:1234:reply.to</code> or <code>comment:1234:reply-to</code>.</p>
<h3 id="hash">Hash<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#hash"></a></h3>
<p><code>field</code> and <code>value</code> form a pair. Both are strings</p>
<ul>
<li>If this were Javascript, 
<ul>
<li>the object name would be the Redis <code>key</code>, </li>
<li>the object key would be the Redis <code>field</code>, </li>
<li>the object value would be the Redis <code>value</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>user:1000: {
    "username": "antirez",
    "birthyear": 1970
}
</code></pre>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HGET &#x3C;key> &#x3C;field></code> / <code>HSET &#x3C;key> &#x3C;field> &#x3C;value></code> - get/set a field+value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lists">Lists<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#lists"></a></h3>
<p>Redis lists are implemented via Linked Lists.</p>
<ul>
<li>LinkedLists were used (as opposed to arrays) because for a database system it is crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.</li>
<li>When fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important, Sorted Sets should be used</li>
</ul>
<p>Common use-cases for Lists</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember the latest updates posted by users into a social network.
<ul>
<li>ex. Twitter takes the latest tweets posted by users into Redis lists.</li>
<li>imagine your home page shows the latest photos published in a photo sharing social network and you want to speedup access.
<ul>
<li>Every time a user posts a new photo, we add its ID into a list with <code>LPUSH</code>.</li>
<li>When users visit the home page, we use <code>LRANGE 0 9</code> in order to get the latest 10 posted items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communication between processes, using a consumer-producer pattern where the producer pushes items into a list, and a consumer (usually a worker) consumes those items and executed actions. Redis has special list commands to make this use case both more reliable and efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LPUSH</code> / <code>RPUSH</code> - add element to the left/right</li>
<li><code>LRANGE &#x3C;listname> &#x3C;fromindex> &#x3C;toindex></code> - extract ranges of elements from lists</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sets">Sets<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sets"></a></h3>
<p>A set is an unordered collections of unique strings (ie, a <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">mathematical set (Private)</a>)</p>
<p>Sets are good for expressing relations between objects. For instance we can easily use sets in order to implement tags.</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple way to model this problem is to have a set for every object we want to tag. The set contains the IDs of the tags associated with the object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods:
<code>SADD</code> - add element to set</p>
<p>Most set operations, including adding, removing, and checking whether an item is a set member, are <code>O(1)</code> (highly efficient).</p>
<ul>
<li>except for <code>SMEMBERS</code> command, which is <code>O(n)</code> and returns the entire set in a single response</li>
</ul>
<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh"># Store a value in the set of favorite book IDs for user 123
> SADD user:123:favorites 742
(integer) 1

# Check whether user 123 likes book 742
> SISMEMBER user:123:favorites 742
(integer) 1
</code></pre>
<h3 id="sorted-sets">Sorted Sets<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sorted-sets"></a></h3>
<p>similar to a mix between a Set and a Hash</p>
<ul>
<li>Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating string elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.</li>
<li>every element in a sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called the score (this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element is mapped to a value).</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods:
<code>ZADD</code> - add element to set
<code>ZREVRANGE</code> - Returns the specified range of elements in the sorted set stored at key</p>
