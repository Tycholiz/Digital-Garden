# Register 
([info](https://www.brianstorti.com/vim-registers/))
- a space in memory with an identifier that vim uses to store text
    - analogous to a clipboard
- access register `a` - `"a`
    - access register in *i mode* - `<C-r>` (instead of `"`)
- vim has a default register, which is where any deleted or yanked text will be
    - denoted `""` - so `p` is shorthand for `""p`
    - this is more like copy/paste
- when writing to a register, lowercase letters will overwrite the register, while uppercase will append to the register
- Sequential register
    - `"1` is most recent (or `""`), `"2` is second most recent, and so on
    - this is only for `dd` and `yy` operation
- Yank register
    - `"0`
- Blackhole register
     - `"_` - prepending a command with this will prevent anything from entering a register.
- Clipboard register
    - `"+`/`"*` - gives access to the system clipboard
- Expression register
    - `"=`
    - when fetching contents from the register, we enter command-line moe
    - an exception to the idea that "registers are containers that hold a block of text"
- use `:reg` to see all registers
    - `:reg a b c` will show registers `a b c`
- copy text into register `r`, then paste it - `"ry`, `"rp`
- *Yank Register* - when yanking, the copied text is placed into the yank register (`"0`), as well as the default register.
- *Delete/yank Register* - `"-`
    - only small delete (ie. no `dd`)
- when using visual mode to make a selection of text that we will replace with `p`, the highlighted text will go into the register as the *pasted* text exits
