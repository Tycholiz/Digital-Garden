### Resistor
- control the electric current as it passes through them. 
	- The colour-coded lines are used to determine their value.
- resistors have many uses including: 
	1. reduce current flow
	2. adjust signal levels
	3. divide voltages. This happens when resistors are lined up in series with each other. 
- resistors dissipate electrical power as heat
	- For bigger applications like a motor, this is exactly what they are used for.
