<ul>
<li>the FAT filesystem uses an index table stored on the device to identify chains of data storage that are associated with a single file. </li>
<li>the table is a linked list of entries for each cluster
<pre><code>- a cluster is an atomic unit of space on a hard disk that can be allocated to hold files.
	- Storing small files on a filesystem with large clusters will therefore waste disk space (slack space)
- being a linked list, each entry contains either the number of the next cluster in the file, or else a marker indicating the end of the file, unused disk space, or special reserved areas of the disk.
	- also, the root directory of the disk contains the number of the first cluster of each file in that directory
	- this enables the operating system to traverse the FAT, looking up the cluster number of each successive part of the disk file as a cluster chain until the end of the file is reached
	- Sub-directories are implemented as special files containing the directory entries of their respective files.
</code></pre>
FAT is a legacy system, and is supported for backward-compatability reasons</li>
