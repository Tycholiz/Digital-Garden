<h1 id="apollo-links">Apollo Links<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#apollo-links"></a></h1>
<p>A system of modular components for GraphQL networking</p>
<pre><code>- Each link represents a subset of functionality that can be composed with other links to create complex control flows of data.
- In a few words, Apollo Links are chainable "units" that you can snap together to define how each GraphQL request is handled by your GraphQL client.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>When you fire a GraphQL request, each Link's functionality is applied one after another, allowing you to control the request lifecycle in a way that makes sense for your application
<ul>
<li>ex. Links can provide retrying, polling, and batching</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At a basic level, a link is a function that takes an operation and returns an observable
<ul>
<li>an operation is an object with information like: query, variables, context</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>links are required when creating an Apollo client instance.</li>
<li>the core of a link is the <code>request</code> method, which accepts the <code>operation</code> (ex. query, mutation) as an argument
<ul>
<li>this method is called every time execute is run on that link chain (typically each time an operation is passed through the link chain)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="http-link">HTTP Link<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#http-link"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>most common Apollo Link</li>
<li>The http link is a terminating link that fetches GraphQL results from a GraphQL endpoint using http
<ul>
<li>This can be used for authentication, persisted queries, dynamic uris, and other granular updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="state-link">State link<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#state-link"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>allows us to use graphql query operations on client state. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="auth-link">Auth link<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#auth-link"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>allows us to add an authorization header to each request</li>
</ul>
