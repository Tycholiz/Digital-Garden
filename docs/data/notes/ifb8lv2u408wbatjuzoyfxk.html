<p>Power output at the receiver antenna (such as the one found in a phone) drops by the inverse square of the distance from the transmitter. Thus, doubling the distance between the antennas decreases the power output by four times. To ensure that the signal strength doesnâ€™t wane, more power is required at the transmitter, which comes at a cost to the battery.   </p>
