<p>ALPN is a TLS extension that allows the application layer to negotiate which protocol should be performed over a secure connection</p>
<ul>
<li>A benefit of this is that it inherently avoids additional round trips</li>
</ul>
<p>ALPN is sent on the initial TLS handshake (Client Hello), and it shows which protocols the client (eg. browser) supports</p>
