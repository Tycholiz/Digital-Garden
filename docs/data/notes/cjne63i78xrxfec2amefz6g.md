### pip
Package manager

### pipenv
Combine Pipfile, pip, and virtualenv into a single toolchain
- can autoimport `requirements.txt`

Goal is to help users manage environments, dependencies, and imported packages

### virtualenv
uses the command-line path environment variable to create isolated Python Virtual Environments (similar to `venv`)
- offers more functionality than `venv`, such as providing convenient features for configuring, maintaining, duplicating, and troubleshooting the virtual environments
