<p>A shader's role is to convert 3D assets into 2D pixels onto the screen.</p>
<p>Consider that a triangle (in 3D space) is made up of three 3D points (vertices), for example:</p>
<pre><code>(-1.03, 000,   0.00)
(0.69,  0.00,  1.00)
(0.69,  0.00, -1.00)
</code></pre>
<p>To show a triangle on the screen, we need to convert these 3D points into 2D points onto a virtual screen (called a Viewport)</p>
<ul>
<li>To figure this out, we need to consider the position/rotation of the triangle, as well as the position/rotation of the camera itself.</li>
<li>All transformations required to convert a 3D point into a 2D point in the viewport can be encoded in a single 4x4 matrix:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
</code></pre>
<p>When you write a Shader, you are primarily responsible for writing a <em>vertex function</em> and a <em>fragment function</em>. The graphics system makes use of these functions, and handles the rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>vertex function is responsible for conversion from 3D to 2D (most of the complicated math can be handled for us by utilizing APIs)</li>
<li>fragment function is responsible for determining which color each pixel within the triangle will be (ie. The fragment function returns a color)
<ul>
<li>this occurs right after rasterization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertex function is also responsible for telling the interpolation system what information to interpolate.</p>
<ul>
<li>whatever data is returned from the vertex function will be interpolated for each pixel and sent to the fragment function:</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertex function runs once for each vertex in the triangle (ie. 3 times per triangle)
Fragment function runs once per pixel that is covered by the triangle.
The rasterization and interpolation step ties the vertex function and fragment function steps</p>
<p>Vertex Function -> position, UV etc -> Interpolation system -> Fragment function -> pixel color to be written to the screen</p>

<p>With a 2D triangle on the screen, rasterization is the process of figuring out which pixels in the screen belong within the triangle.</p>
