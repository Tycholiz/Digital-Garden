when coding a problem, you must first understand what you are coding before you understand how you are coding
- Put another way, you need to understand the underlying logic/business case that you are implementing with code. Understand the issue, understand how a resolution of that issue feels. The what is the important part. Once that's done, the how will flow naturally
