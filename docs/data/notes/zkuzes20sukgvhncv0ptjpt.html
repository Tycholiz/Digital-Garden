<p>A facade is a wrapper that provides a simpler interface to a more complex one.</p>
<ul>
<li>it is about encapsulating a complex subsystem within a single interface object. </li>
<li>an added benefit is it also promotes decoupling the subsystem from its potentially many clients</li>
<li>ex. AWS offers <a href="/notes/2cSifsJxXSKuWR8JiGxJe#lib-packages1">lib packages</a> alongside their lower level packages, as a way to simplify the commands and make it easier to use.</li>
<li>using a facade notably does not prevent users from bypassing the facade and engaging directly with the more complex layers, but gives them the option to interact with a simplified interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>A facade differs from an <a href="/notes/9xKdcGBAmZHfv1f9UOkF5">adapter</a>, since a facade creates a new interface, while an adapter re-uses the old interface.</p>
