<p>AppleScript is a scripting language for doing inter-application communication (IAC) using Apple events (ex. open a file, save a file). Most often, these actions are synchronous.</p>
<p>Whereas <a href="/notes/XxL64EONXsb3pBWjtJhZl">Apple events</a> are a way to send messages into applications, AppleScript is a particular language designed to send Apple events</p>
<ul>
<li>the AppleScript language is designed on the natural language metaphor</li>
</ul>
<p>AppleScript can send and receive Apple events to applications, and can act as a connector between different apps.</p>
<p>AppleScript relies on the functionality of applications and processes to handle complex tasks</p>
<p>AppleScript can be compared to a Unix shell in terms of its purpose</p>
<p>While not all apps are considered scriptable, any app with a graphical user interface responds to Apple Events at a minimal level. This is because OS X uses Apple Events to instruct all apps to perform core tasks such as launching, quitting, opening a document, and printing</p>
<p>A handler in AppleScript is equivalent to a function/method in Javascript</p>
<p>The heart of the AppleScript language is the use of terms that act as nouns and verbs that can be combined. For example, rather than a different verb to print a page, document or range of pages (such as printPage, printDocument, printRange), AppleScript uses a single "print" verb which can be combined with an object, such as a page, a document or a range of pages.</p>
<pre><code>print page 1
print document 2
print pages 1 thru 5 of document 2
</code></pre>

<li>Open a photo in a photo-editing application (by sending that application an Open File Apple event).</li>
<li>Tell the photo-editing application to reduce the resolution of the image</li>
<li>Tell the photo-editing application to save the changed image in a file in some different folder (by sending that application a Save and/or Close Apple event).</li>
<li>Send the new file path (via another Apple event) to a text editor or web editor application</li>
<li>Tell that editor application to write a link for the photo into an HTML file.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps for an entire folder of images (hundreds or even thousands of photos).</li>
<li>Upload the HTML file and folder of revised photos to a website, by sending Apple events to a graphical FTP client, by using built-in AppleScript commands, or by sending Apple events to Unix FTP utilities.</li>
</ol>
