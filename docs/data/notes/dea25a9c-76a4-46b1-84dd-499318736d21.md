A callback is a function you provide as an argument to another function. When that other function has completed its task, it will execute the provided function. In the meantime, however, the code coming after the request will be executed regularly.
- spec: we see that `bcrypt.genSalt` takes in salt as its argument. given its position, this tells us that the function it is a part of will ultimately return that item. looking at the inner one, `hash` is now in that position. that function `bcrypt.hash` returns a hash.
```js
bcrypt.genSalt(10, (err, salt) => {
    if (err) return next(err)
    bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, (err, hash) => {
      if (err) return next(err)
      user.password = hash
      next()
    })
  })
```

This is also the same value that will be used as the parameter taken in with `.then` when working with promises
```js
  bcrypt.genSalt(10)
    .then(salt => {
      return bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt)
    })
    .then(hash => {
      user.password = hash
      next()
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err)
      return next(err)
    })
```
