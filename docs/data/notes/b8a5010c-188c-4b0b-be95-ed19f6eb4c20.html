<p>The Reflog gives a chronological account of how HEAD has moved. Each time it moves, there is a new entry in the Reflog.</p>
<p>The reflog is a list of chronological hashes, which represent where you have been during commits, all without regard to branches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since branches don't matter, we are able to recover dangling commits.</li>
<li>Each time a branch is updated to point to a new reference (ie. HEAD changes), an entry is written in the reflog to say where you were.</li>
<li>Since the branch is updated whenever you commit, the git reflog has a nice effect of storing your local developer's history.</li>
</ul>
<p>It serves as Git's safety net, recording every change made in the repo (regardless of whether it was committed or not)</p>
<ul>
<li>The listed commit hash represents the HEAD after that action.</li>
</ul>
<p>While <code>git log</code> shows a history of the commits, we can think of <code>git reflog</code> as showing us a history of everything (what branch we checked out, what commands we ran etc.)</p>
<p>Becuase it keeps a full history, even if we were to <code>git reset</code>, we can still access the commit SHA</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. we made some commits, then reset. If we decide that we want to <em>undo</em> the reset, all we need to do is checkout the commit we want with <code>git checkout HEAD@{1}</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>ad8621a HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~3
298eb9f HEAD@{1}: commit: Some other commit message
bbe9012 HEAD@{2}: commit: Continue the feature
9cb79fa HEAD@{3}: commit: Start a new feature
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>This puts us in detached head state. All we need to do is create a new branch, and continue working on our feature.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Most of the time, the reflog is our friend in the circumstance where we want to recover data that has been "lost"
<ul>
<li>we can either run <code>git reflog</code>, or use <code>git log -g</code> which gives us normal log output for the reflog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Imagine we hard reset a number of commits, effectively "erasing" them from the git log. All we need to do is find that commit with <code>git log -g</code>, create a new branch with its SHA (<code>git branch recover-branch &#x3C;SHA></code>)</li>
<li>If the data we are looking for is not in the reflog, we can try using <code>git fsck --full</code>, which will list all objects that aren't pointed to by another object.</li>
</ul>
