<p>Redis transactions provide us with 2 guarantees:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the commands in a transaction are serialized and executed sequentially. 
<ul>
<li>This means that a request sent by another client will never be served in the middle of the execution of the transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>EXEC</code> command triggers the execution of all the commands in the transaction, 
<ul>
<li>so if a client loses the connection to the server in the context of a transaction before calling the <code>EXEC</code> command, none of the operations are performed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A Redis Transaction is entered using the <code>MULTI</code> command</p>
<ul>
<li>At this point the user can issue multiple commands. Instead of executing these commands, Redis will queue them. They will all be executed once <code>EXEC</code> is called.</li>
<li>Calling <code>DISCARD</code> will flush the transaction queue and will exit the transaction.</li>
</ul>
