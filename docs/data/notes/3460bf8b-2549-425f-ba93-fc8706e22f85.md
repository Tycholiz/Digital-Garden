# Overview
In a typical message-queueing implementation, a developer installs and configures message-queueing software (a queue manager or broker), and defines a named message queue. Or they register with a message queuing service.
- An application then registers a software routine that "listens" for messages placed onto the queue.
- Second and subsequent applications may connect to the queue and transfer a message onto it.
- The queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and then calls the registered software routine. The receiving application then processes the message in an appropriate manner.

## Message Broker
A message broker is an intermediary computer program module that translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver.

### Examples
- Kafka
- RabbitMQ
- AWS Kinesis
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- Redis (not a message broker per se, but rather has messaging brokering as one of its capabilities)
