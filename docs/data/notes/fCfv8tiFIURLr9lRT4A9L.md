Tags are a way of identifying GameObjects.
- ex. Imagine we have orcs, trolls and Urokhai in the enemy army. We can tag all 3 as `Enemy`, and in our code be able to easily check for all GameObjects with that tag.

Tags can be added by selecting a GameObject and using the dropdown at the top of the *inspector*
