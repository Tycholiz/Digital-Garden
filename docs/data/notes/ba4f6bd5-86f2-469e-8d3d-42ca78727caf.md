# Heap
Contrast with [[stack|memory.stack]]
- A place to store global variables. 
- The heap is not automatically managed for you
- Data structure is hierarchical
- Variables need to be deallocated manually
- Garbage collection runs on the heap
- The heap is slower, but it can also store much more data than the stack
- In C, `malloc` and `calloc` are methods used to interact with the heap. Once memory has been allocated on the heat, we must use `free()` to deallocate that memory. Failure to do this results in whatâ€™s called memory leaks. 
- Pointers must be used to access memory on the heap
- allocating memory is done on the heap, not the stack (as with other variables)
- dynamic memory allocation can only be made through pointers and names (variable names) can't be given
	- `malloc()` is for allocating memory blocks from the heap in C
