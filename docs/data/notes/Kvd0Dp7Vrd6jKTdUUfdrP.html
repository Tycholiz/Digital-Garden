<p>A capacitor is basically a tiny battery</p>
<ul>
<li>potentially carries just enough energy to keep something like memory chip running for a few second
<ul>
<li>this is why when we restart devices to try and fix an issue, we need to leave it off for about 10 seconds. that timespan will ensure that the capacitors are fully drained and the memory chips are all wiped. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
