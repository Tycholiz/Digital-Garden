<p>There are two basic concepts to Sveltekit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each page of your app is a Svelte component</li>
<li>You create pages by adding files to the <code>src/routes</code> directory of your project. These will be server-rendered so that a user's first visit to your app is as fast as possible, then a client-side app takes over</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="router">Router<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#router"></a></h2>
<p>At the heart of SvelteKit is a filesystem-based router. </p>
<p>There are two types of route â€” pages and endpoints.</p>

<p>The value of Sveltekit is similar to the value of Next, but even extending beyond that. Sveltekit takes care of the modern best-practices surrounding web development and does it for you, including build optimizations, so that you load only the minimal required code; offline support; prefetching pages before the user initiates navigation; and configurable rendering that allows you to generate HTML on the server or in the browser at runtime or at build-time.</p>
<p>A filename that has a segment with a leading underscore, such as src/routes/foo/_Private.svelte or src/routes/bar/_utils/cool-util.js, is hidden from the router, but can be imported by files that are not.</p>
