<p>To implement master-slave replication, there are several things that must happen</p>
<ol>
<li>Ordering
<ul>
<li>Imagine if two transactions were to be applied sequentially to a database:
â€” the first writes a new entry and the second deletes this entry, which ultimately results in no data persisting in the database
<ul>
<li>if the ordering is not guaranteed, the delete transaction could be processed first (causing no effect) and then the write transaction applied, which results in data incorrectly persisting in the database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
