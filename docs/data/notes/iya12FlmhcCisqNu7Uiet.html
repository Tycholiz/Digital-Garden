<p>When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters, itâ€™s called Overloading.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is distinct from <code>Overriding</code> which is when we have a method in the child class and a method in the parent class, and they both have the same name. In this case, the method defined in the child would override the parent's version.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overloading implements Compile time polymorphism</p>
