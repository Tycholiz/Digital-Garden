<p>An environment is created every time a shell is initialized
an environment is just a map of key-value pairs</p>
<ul>
<li>Each command is executed in its own environment, which includes (but not limited to):
<ol>
<li>files that have been sourced</li>
<li>current working directory</li>
<li>functions defined during execution, or inherited from shell's parent in the environment</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When a non-builtin command is executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since every instance of a shell is a separate process, we have a different set of environment variables in each shell</p>
<ul>
<li>they can be seen by running <code>env</code>
<ul>
<li>That isn’t all the variables that are set in your shell, though. It’s just the environment variables that are exported to processes that you start in the shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>compgen -v</code> allows us to see <em>all</em> variables available in shell</li>
<li><code>export</code> allows us to add parameters and functions to the environment</li>
<li>When a non-builtin command is executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="export"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#export"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Export</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exported variables get passed on to child processes, not-exported variables do not.
<ul>
<li>When we use <code>export</code> in bash, we are adding the variable onto the shell's list of all env variables. This list is exclusive to the shell. When this shell creates a child process, all of these env variables are made available to it.</li>
<li>This means that if we only need the variable in the current environment, then we don't need to use <code>export</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the environment variables that an application can see are based on how the application was launched (from the dock, from the commandline, etc)</p>
