<p>A struct is a composite type </p>
<ul>
<li>Stands for “user defined data structure”</li>
</ul>
<p>In C++, it is similar to a class (though by default the access level is public)</p>
<ul>
<li>A struct is similar to an interface, in that we define a shape, which effectively becomes our new composite type. We can then initialize new variables that take this shape</li>
<li>The primary use of struct is for the construction of complex datatypes</li>
<li>Consider that a composite type such as this is analogous to a record in a database table. In a table, we implicitly create a type that has the same shape of the table  (in this sense the composite type is called a record)</li>
<li>All variables contained in a struct are physically located together. The consequence of this is that we can access the struct with a single pointer</li>
</ul>
