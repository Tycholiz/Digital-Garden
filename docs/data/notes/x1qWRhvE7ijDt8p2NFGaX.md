The multitenancy architecture permits the use of a single software instance to server multiple distinct user groups.
- Conversely, single tenancy means that the software instance has only 1 end user (or group of users, e.g. one organization).

A SaaS offering is an example of multitenant architecture.

In cloud computing, multitenancy is also referred to as "shared hosting".
