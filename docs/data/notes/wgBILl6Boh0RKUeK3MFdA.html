<p>A repeater is a networked device that broadcasts the same data out of each of its ports and lets each device decide what data they need</p>
<ul>
<li>since repeaters amplify a signal, they need a source of electric power</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeaters operate on <a href="/notes/hJrvVw03nGGkjh0doYT4f#l1-physical1">L1</a> of the OSI model, since they do not try to interpret the data being transmitted</p>
<ul>
<li>anal: in Lord of the Rings, Gondor has a series of beacons that can be lit to communicate to the whole kingdom that war has been declared. Each repeater (beacon) receives a signal and retransmits it (by lighting up their own beacon)</li>
</ul>
