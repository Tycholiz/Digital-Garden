<h1 id="select">Select<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#select"></a></h1>
<p>SELECT is known as a "projection" in relational algebra.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once you’ve generated your table reference, filtered it, transformed it, you can step to projecting it to another form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the SELECT clause, you can finally operate on columns, creating complex column expressions as parts of the row.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SELECT accepts expressions, allowing us to say <code>select (temp_lo + temp_hi)/2 as temp_avg...</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SELECT clause may be one of the most complex clauses in SQL, even if it appears so simple. All other clauses just “pipe” table references from one to another</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to understand SQL, it is important to understand everything else first, before trying to tackle SELECT</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>remove duplicate rows <em>after</em> the SELECT has been applied (in other words, after the projection)</p>

<p>The queries that involve UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT need to follow these rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of columns and their orders must be the same in the two queries.</li>
<li>The data types of the respective columns must be compatible.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>By manually listing out each column we want to project, we show the intention of the code. Listing out each column allows for declaring our thinking as developers</li>
<li>When we implicitly select all columns, if the columns on a table change (eg. we remove a column), then the implementations where we call <code>SELECT *</code> may not be happy with the new dataset returned.
<ul>
<li>Maybe the column we just removed was a dependency of that module. If we had manually listed out each column, then the error would have been more clear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It isn't efficient to retrieve all bytes of data, when we don't even need them all.</li>
