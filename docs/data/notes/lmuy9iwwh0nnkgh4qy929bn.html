<p>In GraphQL apps, batching usually takes one of two forms. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>take all operations and combine them into a single operation using the <code>alias</code> feature in GraphQL. </p>
<ul>
<li>This approach is not recommended, however, since this removes the ease of tracking metrics on a per-operation basis and adds additional complexity to the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>send an array of operations to a GraphQL server, having the server recognize the request as an array of operations instead of a single one, and handle each operation separately. </p>
<ul>
<li>This method still requires only a single round-trip, while retaining the ability to track single operation performance. Apollo Client handles batching like this using <code>apollo-link-batch-http</code>. Itâ€™s also worth noting that this method requires the server to be able to receive an array of operations as well as single operations. Luckily, <code>apollo-server</code> supports this out of the box.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
