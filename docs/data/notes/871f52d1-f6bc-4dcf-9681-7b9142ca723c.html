<ul>
<li>3-2-1 rule of backups: 3 copies, 2+ formats, at least one copy offsite.</li>
<li>If something is built into a software workflow, then it is not a backup
<ul>
<li>ex. Joplin sync does not count as backup, nor does Mackup. The reason is that we interact with these tools in a dynmaic way. We don't treat them as immutable snapshots. A backup is only a backup if it's immutable (or treated as such).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you haven't yet tried to restore all of your data via your backup file, then you don't have a backup system in place.</li>
</ul>
