### Action
Actions are standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job
Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow. You can create your own actions, or use actions created by the GitHub community

For instance, we have the `checkout@v2` action, which allows the runner to checkout a repo. In fact, we can checkout any SHA from any repo.
