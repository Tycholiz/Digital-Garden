An RSS feed is an application with a data layer that stores URLs that return XML data from a feed.
ex. we store `https://reddit.com/r/investing.rss` in the database, and when I open the RSS feed, a GET request is made and all the posts are returned.

### Make a subreddit RSS feed
Simply add `.rss` to the subreddit URL
- ex. `https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey.rss`
