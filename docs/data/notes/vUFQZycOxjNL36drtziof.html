<p>"The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices."
Application of law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguish essential content from secondary content. By enabling users to find a path through fewer choices, you’ll reduce their cognitive burden.</li>
<li>ex. When creating navigation instead of providing an endless list of choices, focus on just a few.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fitts-law">Fitt's Law<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fitts-law"></a></h3>
<p>"The time it takes to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target."</p>
<ul>
<li>ie. The farther away a target is — a button on a screen, for example — the larger it needs to be for a user to be able to reach it easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>"The average person can only keep 7±2  items in their working memory. In short: there’s only so much we can hold in our heads in a short space of time."</p>
<ul>
<li>Miller’s law is particularly important when we consider how we organize and group information, and is where chunking can come in useful</li>
<li>Where possible look for groups of information that can be broken down and chunked, enabling them to be held more easily in users’ working memory.</li>
</ul>
