<ul>
<li>A place in memory where variables declared by a function are stored</li>
<li>Any time we create a variable In a normal way, we are putting it on the stack</li>
<li>Every time a function declares a new variable, it is "pushed" onto the stack. Then every time a function exits, all of the variables pushed onto the stack by that function are deleted.</li>
<li>when a function exits, all of its variables are popped off of the stack. Thus stack variables are local in nature</li>
<li>variables are declared, stored and initialized during runtime.</li>
<li>Storage is temporary, and when The computing task is complete, the memory location will be erased</li>
<li>Data structure is linear</li>
<li>Data is physically located together (contiguous blocks)</li>
<li>Variable de-allocation is automatic</li>
<li>The stack is a LIFO data structure</li>
</ul>
