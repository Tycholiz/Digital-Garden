## VPS Hosting vs Shared Hosting
### Shared Hosting
- share space on a server along with other websites.
- best utilized for static sites.

### VPS Hosting
- have superuser access to system
- for practical purposes, they are functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server.
- underlying hardware is shared with other VPSes, which may result in lower performance 
- the virtualization aspect provides a high level of security.
- Because each virtual server is isolated from the others, it can run its own OS
- the physical server runs a hypervisor, which creates, manages, and allocates resources to the guest OSes (VMs)
