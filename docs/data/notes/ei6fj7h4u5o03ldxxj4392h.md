Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.

### Chart
Helm uses a packaging format called *charts*, which is a collection of yaml files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. 
- A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a [[node|js.node]] [[deployment|k8s.objects.deployment]], or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.
