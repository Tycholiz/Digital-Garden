<p>A magnet link is a type of hyperlink that enables the downloading of files and data from P2P sharing networks, particularly torrent networks. It works in a server-less environment and contains all the information a torrent client requires to download a specific file. Once the user clicks a magnet link, its data is sent to the desktop torrent client software, which automatically starts the download.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is preferable to a .torrent file because it eliminates the need to download a tracker file and search for uploading peers.</li>
<li>Therefore, a magnet link replaces a .torrent file extension/mechanism with only a hyperlink, which consists of the magnet identifier, file name and cryptographic content hash.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of magnets is instead of downloading the <code>.torrent</code> file from a webserver, you download it directly from a seed/leecher. The biggest advantage is that you might be able to download the content of the torrent, even if the tracker is down or closed for registration.</p>
<p>The main advantage for Bittorrent indexers is that they do not have to store the torrents on their servers anymore which could be beneficial for them in several ways. It could reduce the pressure from the media creation industry and reduce hardware infrastructure expenses thanks to less tracking and downloading.</p>
