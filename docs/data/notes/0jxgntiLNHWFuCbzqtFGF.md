Never send to generic emails, like `info@[businessname].com`. This hurts your sender reputation score

## Inbox Zero
'Zero' refers to how much time we should be thinking about our email inbox.

### Core Principles
- keep email client closed for most of the day, only opening it at regular intervals
	- ex. set recurring reminders at 9:00, 12:00, 3:00 and 5:00 to open the client.
- when going over emails, one of 5 actions must be taken: `delete`, `delegate`, `respond`, `defer`, or `do`.
- always respond immediately to messages that can be answered in 2 min or less

### Other ideas
- Set up mail filters so that each piece of mail has a folder destination based on what it is. Don't overdo itâ€” a few folders is sufficient.
	- redirect newsletters to a `read` folder, mark emails addressed to you as *important* etc.
