<p>The idea of Apollo Federation is that the organization should expose a single supergraph that provides a unified interface for querying all of our backing data sources. </p>
<ul>
<li>However, we wouldn't want to do this with a single Graphql Server, so we'll string many subgraphs together into what's called a Gateway. This gateway acts as a proxy to the subgraphs.

</ul>
<p>The Federated approach differs from achieving the same result via <em>schema stitching</em>, since it uses a declarative programming model that enables each subgraph to implement only the part of your composed supergraph that it's responsible for.</p>
<p>Apollo Federation encourages <a href="/notes/rJCjWKYnnHAyCCtIwZ8kj">Separation of Concerns</a>, allowing different teams to work on different products/features within a single graph without interfering others.</p>
<p>Each subgraph should define the types and fields that it is capable of (and should be responsible for) populating from its back-end data store.</p>
