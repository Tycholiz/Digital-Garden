<ul>
<li>a cache of database connections maintained so that the connections can be reused when future requests to the database are required
<ul>
<li>after a connection is created, it is placed in the pool and it is used again so that a new connection does not have to be established</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The client pool allows you to have a reusable pool of clients you can check out, use, and return
<ul>
<li>used to enhance the performance of executing commands on a database</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you're working on a web application or other software which makes frequent queries you'll want to use a connection pool.</li>
<li>Connecting a new client to the PostgreSQL server requires a handshake which can take 20-30 milliseconds. During this time passwords are negotiated, SSL may be established, and configuration information is shared with the client &#x26; server. Incurring this cost every time we want to execute a query would substantially slow down our application.</li>
<li>Typically, each application server instance would have its own pool
<ul>
<li>ex. If there are 4 Express servers running, then there will be 4 pools</li>
<li>between those 4 servers and the users sending requests to them sits a <em>load balancer</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The pool sits between the application server(s) and the database:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>CLIENTs → load balancer → Express → pool → database
</code></pre>
<p>With Postgraphile</p>
<ul>
<li>The rootPgPool is not normally what is used with PostGraphile because its privileges are too elevatedt. typically you use rootPgPool for authentication tasks like Passport.js.</li>
</ul>
