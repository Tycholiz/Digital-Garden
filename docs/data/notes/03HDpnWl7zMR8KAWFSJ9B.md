# Fargate
- serverless compute engine for containers
- adds about 20% in price, but removes a lot of the admin overhead
- removes the need to provision and manage servers
	- don't have to worry about scaling, patching, securing, and managing servers
- Fargate automates how much computing power you need and will scale up/down automatically
- with Fargate, you only interact with your containers
