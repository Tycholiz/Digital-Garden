<p>A char holds the ASCII value, rather than the character itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, by definition a <code>char</code> is just a small integer</li>
<li>We can leverage the fact that a char will evaluate to its ASCII value, by performing math on them
<ul>
<li>ex. we can test if something is a digit like with <code>if (val >= '0' &#x26;&#x26; val &#x3C; '9')</code>. Here, the <code>'0'</code> and <code>'9'</code> get converted to their ASCII values as the comparison is made. As it so happens, any ASCII value between 48 and 57 is a digit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A char is a single byte</li>
</ul>
