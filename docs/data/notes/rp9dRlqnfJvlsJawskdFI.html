<p>The most common subdomain is <code>www</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The www subdomain is so widely used that most domain registrars include it with domain name purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of subdomain can be achieved in 2 different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>The DNS zone file pertaining to the parent domain can be edited
<ul>
<li>in other words, subdomains are contained within parent domains (this is not the case for the second)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a record can be made to map a name to the A record.
<ul>
<li>network operations teams consider the second to not really be a subdomain, and instead restrict the definition to only including those subdomains which are provided by the zone NS records, and any server-destination other than that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
