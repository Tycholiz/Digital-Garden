<p>Strong consistency means replication happens synchronously across data nodes</p>
<ul>
<li>This means subsequent read operations must all return the same latest data, no matter which replica was queried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-it-happen">How does it happen?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-does-it-happen"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>the server (client) executes a write operation against the primary database instance</li>
<li>the primary instance propagates the written data to the replica instance</li>
<li>the replica instance sends an acknowledgment signal to the primary instance</li>
<li>the primary instance sends an acknowledgment signal to the client</li>
</ol>
<p>The popular use cases of the strong consistency model are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>File systems</li>
<li>Relational databases</li>
<li>Financial services such as banking</li>
<li>Semi-distributed consensus protocols such as two-phase commit (2PC)</li>
<li>Fully distributed consensus protocols such as Paxos</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Spanner and Google Bigtable both use strong consistency </p>

<h3 id="linearizability">Linearizability<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#linearizability"></a></h3>
<p>Linearizability is a variant of strong consistency and is also known as atomic consistency</p>
<p>The following techniques can be used to implement linearizability:</p>
<ul>
<li>single leader to handle both read and write operations</li>
<li>distributed consensus algorithm such as Paxos</li>
<li>distributed quorum</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantages of linearizability are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>makes a distributed system behave as if the system were non-distributed</li>
<li>simple for application to use</li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantages of linearizability are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>degraded performance</li>
<li>limited scalability</li>
<li>reduced availability</li>
</ul>
