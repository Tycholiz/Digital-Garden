# Cursor
- a cursor is a piece of data (likely just an ID) that represents a location in a paginated list.
- the cursor is the thing that allows us to traverse over records in a database
- A cursor can be viewed as a pointer to one row within a set of rows
- cursors also facilitate retrieval of the records, as well as creating and removing records
- a cursor is conceptually and behaviourally very similar to an iterator
- Cursors are used to process individual rows returned by database system queries
- a cursor makes it possible to define a result set and perform complex logic on it, on a row by row basis
