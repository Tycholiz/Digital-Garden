<p>IP is often described as an "unreliable" protocol because it does not provide any guarantees about the delivery of data packets.</p>
<ul>
<li>packets are sent from a source device to a destination device without any acknowledgement of receipt or verification of the packet's successful delivery, meaning that packets can be lost, delayed, or corrupted in transit, and there is no built-in mechanism to detect or recover from these errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though IP itself it unreliable, <a href="/notes/d2e2hSjyVoKd0AmH4P1Yj">TCP</a> is often built on top of it, which is in fact a reliable protocol.</p>
