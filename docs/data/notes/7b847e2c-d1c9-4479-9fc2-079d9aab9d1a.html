<p>The <code>A</code> record is the most fundamental record
maps the IP address to a given domain</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the <code>A record</code> serves as a lookup for the IP address of a given domain</li>
<li>it is normal to have just one A record. </li>
<li><code>AAAA</code> for IPv6</li>
</ul>
<p>a value of 14400 for TTL means that if an A record gets updated, it takes 240 minutes (14400 seconds) to take effect.</p>
<p>Most websites have a single A record, but with multiple A records, you can implement round robin load balancing</p>
