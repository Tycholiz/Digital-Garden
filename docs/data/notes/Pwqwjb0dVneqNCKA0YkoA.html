<p>Bundling is process of taking all of your Javascript code (including <code>node_modules</code>) and reducing it down to a single file.</p>
<ul>
<li>the remaining bundle is as small as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bundling is normally a concept not found in <a href="/notes/5iC7cpurvsTcO6WDflzOZ">Node.js</a> code, since the size Node.js code on a server doesn't really matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>however, there are use-cases for bundling Node.js code. For instance, if we are building multiple Lambdas in a single project using <a href="/notes/nRb6Im4Kcmc2ZWE7K1jZ1">Serverless Framework</a>, there is a benefit to bundling, since smaller Lambdas are downloaded from <a href="/notes/2Rtof8yGX9K2Tq6tLljBb">S3 (Simple Storage Service)</a> faster, reducing cold start times.
<ul>
<li>in this case, use ESBuild</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of bundling as a <a href="/notes/2k8qfv0q9ce2cai8hf5313m">MapReduce</a> operation that maps over all source files and "reduces" them into a bundle.</p>
<p>Before ES modules were available in browsers, developers had no native mechanism for authoring JavaScript in a modularized fashion. This is why we are all familiar with the concept of "bundling": using tools that crawl, process and concatenate our source modules into files that can run in the browser.</p>

<p>The bundler looks through the code and uses only the imported modules (third-party and your own), thereby elminimating all the modules that aren't a part of the project.</p>
