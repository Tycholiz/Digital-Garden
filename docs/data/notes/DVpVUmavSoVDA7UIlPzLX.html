<p>The digital world is inherently reproducible at no cost. Data can be copied freely. The use of a blockchain removes this characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain represents digital scarcity in the same way that packets Represent digital information</li>
</ul>
<p>Blockchain takes the concept of open source one step further where it is Open State, meaning not just the source code is shared, but the data (ie. the chain itself) is shared as well</p>
<p>Every scarce asset is well-suited to be block-chainified</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Stocks, bonds, mortgages, marriage certificate, passports</li>
</ul>
