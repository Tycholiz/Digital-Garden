A fully managed [[Lake|data.lake]].

All we need to do is define data sources and what access and security policies you want to apply.
- Lake Formation then helps you collect and catalog data from databases and object storage, move the data into your new [[S3|aws.svc.S3]] data lake, clean and classify your data using ML algorithms, and secure access to your sensitive data using granular controls at the column, row, and cell-levels.
