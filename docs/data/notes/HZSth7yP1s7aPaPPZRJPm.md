### Scaling Types
Vertical Scaling 
- getting bigger machines to handle the increasing workload.
    - ie. make each node more powerful (adding CPUs etc)
Horizontal Scaling 
- getting many more smaller machines to handle the increase.
    - ie. add more nodes
- ex. Kubernetes does this by spinning up new containers
- ex. Azure functions does this by spinning up new function handlers
