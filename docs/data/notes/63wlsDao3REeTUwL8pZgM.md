Holds information about all domains sharing the common TLD
- ex. a `com` TLD nameserver contains information for all the `.com` sites.

When queried, the top-level nameserver returns the names and addresses of the nameservers that are authoritative for the second-level zone that the domain name ends in (e.g. `facebook.com`)

broken into 2 groups:
	1. Generic TLD, like .com, .org, .net, .edu, and .gov.
	2. Country code TLD, like .ca, .uk

- overseen by IANA (a branch of ICANN)
