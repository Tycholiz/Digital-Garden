<p>the recursive resolver is at the beginning of the DNS query (with the authoritative nameserver at the end).</p>
<ul>
<li>the resolver receives requests from web browsers, and in turn makes additional requests to the rest of the servers in a final effort to resolve the query. </li>
<li>a resolver will tell us what the IP is, given a domain name. By default, if a resolver cannot tell us, then that is it. However, the fact that it is recursive means that not only can we query a resolver, but a resolver can make queries itself. Put another way, if it doesn't have the answer we are looking for, it has the capacity to make queries itself. </li>
<li>After receiving a request for a webpage, the resolver will either respond with cached data (given to it by the nameservers), or will send a request to the <em>root nameserver</em>, followed by a request to a <em>TLD nameserver</em>, and then one last request to an <em>authoritative nameserver</em> (This is called <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/fa38f0e2-5d5b-45e1-9f54-a95c44d8bbd5">DNS Lookup</a>)
<ul>
<li>At each step, there is a possibility that a cached version of the website will be found, and it can immediately be returned to the client, rather than continuing to recurse down the DNS tree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After receiving the requested IP address (from the authoritative nameserver), the recursive resolver sends a response to the client</li>
</ul>
<p>DNS Client (aka <em>Resolver</em>) is a client machine configured to send name resolution queries to a DNS server</p>
<ul>
<li>in other words, our computer is a DNS client when it sends requests to port 53 of a DNS server, with the intention of resolving an IP address  </li>
</ul>
