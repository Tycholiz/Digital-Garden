<p>Also known as SSL/TLS certificates</p>
<p>Used to authenticate the identity of a server to the client that is trying to connect to it.</p>
<p>When a server certificate gets installed on a website, HTTPS gets enabled, and the certificate chain gets created, the result of which vouches for the authenticity of the website.</p>
<ul>
<li>When we hop on to our computers and type in a website URL, the server certificate ensures that the data flow between our client browser and the domain weâ€™re trying to reach stays secure</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on PKI</p>

<p>Used to validate the identity of a client.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this way, it serves as a password, as in theory, no one should be able to produce that certificate but the true client.</li>
<li>Client certs don't encrypt any data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Client certificates exist because passwords aren't that secure.</p>
<p>Client certificates use the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication (just as server certificates do).</p>
<ul>
<li>Difference is that client certificates don't encrypt any data; they are just for validation purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contain "Issued to" and "Issued by" fields</p>
