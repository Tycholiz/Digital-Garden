<p><strong>Scheduling</strong> is the action of assigning work to different resources in a system. </p>
<ul>
<li>this work is carried out on threads.
Therefore a thread is the smallest amount of instructions that can be handled by a scheduler.</li>
<li>think of it as the atomic unit from the scheuler's perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>process</strong> is an instance of a program that is being executed on 1 or more threads.</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple threads can exist on process simultaneously.
<ul>
<li>the number of threads depends on the programming language and source code that the process is running on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>threads within a process share resources like memory, but threads in different processes to not share resources.</li>
<li>a process can be forked (split) into many child processes</li>
</ul>

<p>If a single process in a multi-process application crashes, that process alone dies.  The buffer is flushed, and all the other child processes continue happily along.  In a multi-threaded environment, when one thread dies, they all die.</p>
<ul>
<li>On some OSs, processes tend to be more expensive than threads (though on Linux, the difference is not that great)</li>
</ul>
