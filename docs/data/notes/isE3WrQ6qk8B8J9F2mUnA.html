<ul>
<li>studios produce a design document; a single source of truth for its creative direction (for a film, this would be roughly adjacent to a script or storyboard)
<ul>
<li>includes information about the story, gameplay, art direction, intended target audience and accessibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>purpose is to iterate quickly while costs to do so are low. This is no different than designing a website mocks/designs/user testing before actually building the website.</li>
</ul>

<p>project is evaluated, edited, polished, and fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li>includes alpha and beta testing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="designer"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#designer"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Designer</h3>
<ul>
<li>conceives of gameplay and the structure/rules of the game</li>
<li>often the main visionary of the game</li>
<li>One of the roles of a designer is being a writer, often employed part-time to conceive game's narrative, dialogue, commentary, cutscene narrative, journals, video game packaging content, hint system, etc.</li>
<li>they are responsible for various parts of the game, such as, game mechanics, user interface, characters, dialogue, graphics, etc</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="artist"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#artist"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Artist</h3>
<ul>
<li>designs video game art</li>
<li>An artists work may be 2d oriented or 3D oriented</li>
<li>2D artists may produce concept art, sprites, textures, environmental backdrops or terrain images, and user interface. 3D artists may produce models or meshes, animation, 3D environment, and cinematics. Artists sometimes occupy both roles.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programmer"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#programmer"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Programmer</h3>
<p>The programmer develops video games or related software (such as game development tools).</p>
<p>Individual programming disciplines roles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physics – the programming of the game engine, including simulating physics, collision, object movement, etc.;</li>
<li>AI – producing computer agents using game AI techniques, such as scripting, planning, rule-based decisions, etc.</li>
<li>Graphics – the managing of graphical content utilization and memory considerations; the production of graphics engine, integration of models, textures to work along the physics engine.</li>
<li>Sound – integration of music, speech, effect sounds into the proper locations and times.</li>
<li>Gameplay – implementation of various games rules and features (sometimes called a generalist);</li>
<li>Scripting – development and maintenance of high-level command system for various in-game tasks, such as AI, level editor triggers, etc.</li>
<li>UI – production of user interface elements, like option menus, HUDs, help and feedback systems, etc.</li>
<li>Input processing – processing and compatibility correlation of various input devices, such as keyboard, mouse, gamepad, etc.</li>
<li>Network communications – the managing of data inputs and outputs for local and internet gameplay.</li>
<li>Game tools – the production of tools to accompany the development of the game, especially for designers and scripters.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>a person who creates levels, challenges or missions for video games using a specific set of programs. These programs may be commonly available commercial 3D or 2D design programs, or specially designed and tailored level editors made for a specific game (like Wowedit)</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as the actual development of the game goes, there are 2 main routes: programming and designing.</p>
