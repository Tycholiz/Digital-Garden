### Project Groups
Multiple repos with some common business-level relation can be placed in a *group*
- ex. Imagine we have a [[microservice|general.arch.microservice]] architecture with 1000+ repos. It is expected groups would form out of these, based on their underlying domains.

We can have up to 20 levels of subgroups.
