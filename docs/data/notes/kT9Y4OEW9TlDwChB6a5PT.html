<p>Decentralized computing is the allocation of resources (both hardware and software) to each individual machine.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most business computing requirements are trivial operations for a computer to perform. As a result, most desktop computers would remain idle for a significant portion of time, if we were taking a more traditional centralized approach. A decentralized system can use the potential of these systems to maximize efficiency.</p>
<p>Decentralized means that there is no single point where the decision is made. Every node makes a decision for itâ€™s own behaviour and the resulting system behaviour is the aggregate response, which would result from a single server if this was a centralized system.</p>
<p>In decentralized systems, there are many machines that each store a copy of the same resources that users can access. This allows us key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows us to place edge nodes closer to users, thereby improving performance to them.</li>
<li>It allows us to be more <a href="/notes/mh3gii3m3gs5etkb2alcifl">fault tolerant</a>. If several nodes fail, extant ones may pick up the slack and allow the system to remain functional.</li>
</ul>
