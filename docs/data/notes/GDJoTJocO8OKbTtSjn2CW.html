<p>Domain Driven Design is the concept that we should design our application code with heavy consideration into the business logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. we don't know if it will always be the case that you must be a user to purchase a book. Therefore, we shouldn't design the system in a way where we can't accomplish that easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>DDD is about thinking about your software in terms of business application, instead of looking at it in terms of technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>ie. we are writing for the needs of the business</li>
<li>we achieve this by defining models for our domain, and then writing software that conforms to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>DDD has nothing to do with writing code in a certain way. Rather, it's about understanding the underlying logic behind the problems you need to solve. It's the thinking about domains that drives the design of the code. In a way, DDD is the opposite of jumping right in with code and trying to solve something without thinking about it beforehand.</p>
<ul>
<li>"The novice jumps in right away with code. The veteran ponders the problem they are solving, and thinks (in code) about the logic of that problem"</li>
</ul>
<p>DDD is all about unifying all of the code in a way that is highly comprehensible to those uninvolved with the code's creation. That is, focus is placed on the high level business logic and domain delineations.</p>
<ul>
<li>At a trivial level, it’s all about the names you use for things.  </li>
<li>at the level above that, it’s about the way that you combine and activate things to produce business value.  </li>
<li>at the level above that, it’s the causal and relationship (semantic) model that keeps everything cohesive, coherent, and aligned with the business.  </li>
<li>this alignment can’t come from an implementation-focused model. you must use a domain model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralizes (business) domain logic into the software to account for changes in understanding and business needs and to improve longevity </li>
<li>Helps us understand where we should be investing (strategic) and how to build it (tactical) - investing in the parts of the business that are core </li>
<li>Understanding the problem helps align everyone to produce better solutions and more effective communication</li>
</ul>
<p>Key ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collaboratively model the domain so that your software reads like the problem it solves.</li>
<li>Isolate your software and establish context in each part of it. There should be enough previously handled assertions that you have a good idea of what's going to happen while looking at any random line of code. (Not sure how to word this one)</li>
<li>You don't have to model the domain <em>exactly</em>.
(Use abstraction to get rid of unnecessary details, and sometimes it makes sense to model things as they are used rather than what they actually are)</li>
</ol>

<p>The building blocks of DDD are <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/X9TyB7Fn9NNAUyakav5Pz">value objects</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can also be thought of as <em>domain primitives</em>.</li>

<p>a domain model is an abstraction of the subdomain. Not every aspect of the domain can be part of the model. It's the aspects chosen for implementation that constitute the model.</p>
<ul>
<li>this means that we don't just think in terms of what the object can do; we think of it in terms of what we <em>want</em> it to do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine we wanted to build a house. We would first need to determine what type of house we are building. Detached? Condo? Duplex? Farmhouse?</p>
<p>After determining this, we would talk to the domain expert, which would probably be a farmer. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notably, it's not the architect, since they wouldn't have the in-depth domain knowledge required to design everything.

<li>
<p>Domain: Farmyard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sub-domains: Barn, Stables, Farmhouse, Garden gate, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domain model: The layout/plans for each sub-domain (e.g. the layout of the farmhouse)</p>
<ul>
<li>analogous relationship:
<ul>
<li>classes -> objects</li>
<li>domain model -> bounded contexts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ubiquitous language: in the layout, we have rooms like Family room, Bedroom, Bathroom. This is the ubiquitous language of the domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/eJh8ewMkDq2LpJPqC6fX8">Bounded context</a>: The parts circled in blue.</p>
<ul>
<li>language used in each bounded context is specific. For example, "caretaker" of the stables and "caretaker" of the farmhouse are two different things.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Tactical design tools are concerned with implementation details of the components inside a bounded context
tactical design is expected to change over the process of development</p>
