<h1 id="change-list">Change List<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#change-list"></a></h1>
<p>Vim remembers the locations where changes occurred. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each position (column number, line number) is recorded in a change list, and each buffer has a separate change list that records the last 100 positions where an undo-able change occurred.</li>
<li>if you make a change at a certain position, then make another change nearby, only the location of the later change is recorded 
<ul>
<li>"nearby" means on the same line, within a certain number of bytes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
