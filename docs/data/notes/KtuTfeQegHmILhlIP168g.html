<p>Stacks are linear data structures in a LIFO (last-in, first-out) order. Now, what does that mean? Imagine a stack of plates. The last plate that you put on top of the stack is the first one you take out. Stacks work that way: the last value you add is the first one you remove.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common functions in a stack are <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>isEmpty</code>, and <code>peek</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with queues, stacks are the most the basic list types in computing</p>
<p>A stack has a number of useful applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backtracking to a previous state</li>
<li>Expression evaluation and conversion</li>
</ul>
