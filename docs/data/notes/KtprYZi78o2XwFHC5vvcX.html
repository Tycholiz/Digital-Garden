<h1 id="cpu-clock">CPU Clock<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cpu-clock"></a></h1>
<p>CPUs have electronic clocks in them, in fact itâ€™s a fundamental part of how they operate as the electronics within a CPU have to operate in a synchronised way.</p>
<p>The clock is a crystal that oscillates a predictable number of times each second when electricity is passed through it. Counting these oscillations allows the computer to measure the passing of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>these atomic clocks use the vibrations of atoms to keep time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clocks are not perfectly accurate: it <em>drifts</em> (ie. runs faster or slower than it should). As a result, one machine may be faster or slower than another machine.</p>
<ul>
<li>This adds an interesting wrinkle to <a href="/notes/vutujFFWxQu6TshWVuMpI">distributed</a> systems, and is a reason we can't depend on the clock to determine the ordering of events.</li>
<li>It is possible to synchronize clocks to some degree: the most commonly used mechanism is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which allows the computer clock to be adjusted according to the time reported by a group of servers. The servers in turn get their time from a more accurate time source, such as a GPS receiver.</li>
<li>Clock drift varies depending on the temperature of the machine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-use-them">Why use them?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-use-them"></a></h2>
<p>The accuracy of an atomic clock matters in computing because time synchronization is critical for many computing tasks, such as </p>
<ul>
<li>coordinating distributed systems, 
<ul>
<li>Without accurate timekeeping, distributed systems may not be able to coordinate their activities effectively, leading to issues such as data corruption, incorrect results, or system crashes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>scheduling tasks, </li>
<li>maintaining data consistency. </li>
</ul>
