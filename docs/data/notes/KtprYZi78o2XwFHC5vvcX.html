<p>CPUs have electronic clocks in them, in fact itâ€™s a fundamental part of how they operate as the electronics within a CPU have to operate in a synchronised way.</p>
<p>The clock is a crystal that oscillates a predictable number of times each second when electricity is passed through it. Counting these oscillations allows the computer to measure the passing of time.</p>
