<p>A Data Lake is a single centralized repository that can accept all of our data in whatever format it comes in.</p>
<p>AWS implementation would be <a href="/notes/2Rtof8yGX9K2Tq6tLljBb">S3</a></p>
<p>The purpose is to have all of our data in a single place so that we can perform ultra-informed analytics on the data. the alternative would be that we pull data from each data layer, aggregating it and transforming it somehow into a single format so that we could feet it into an analytics engine.</p>
<ul>
<li>spec: The purpose is not to have lightning-fast query speeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can run different types of analytics on the data to guide better decision-making.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. dashboards and visualizations, big data processing, real-time analytics, machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>it is often very technically involved to build and maintain a data lake.</p>
