Running code concurrently is part of the language.
- Itâ€™s faster than scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Javascript.

Go follows an imperative (procedural, structural) paradigm

The final application is a binary compiled statically without any dependency.
- You just need to drop the executable on your server to deploy the application.

In Go, once the `main()` function finishes, the program exits.
- this can cause unexpected behaviours with concurrency.

Go is often used for building systems that require high performance and low latency, because they offer better control over memory management and are generally faster than higher-level languages like JavaScript.
