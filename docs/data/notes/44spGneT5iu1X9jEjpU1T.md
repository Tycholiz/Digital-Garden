### Approaches to common problems arising because of a distributed system
#### Key Generation System
Imagine we were making a URL shortener like TinyURL. As a database solution, we opt for a NoSQL approach key-value store, where each key is the shortform URL, and the value is the longform URL.

##### Naive approach
Each time a write request is made (ie. user creates a new shortform URL), the application server generates a new random 6 character string, and attempts to insert it into the DB. If that key exists already, then it tries again, until there is no failure. This is naive because it involves a lot of back and forth between application server and database, and results in an unpredictable time complexity.

##### Smarter approach
Have a standalone Key Generation Service (KGS), which generates the random 6 character strings in advance and stores them in a separate database (the Key-DB). Whenever a user wants to generate a new TinyURL, we take a key from the Key-DB and use it. This takes out the worry of collision and duplications of keys.

The purpose of the 2 tables is to handle read concurrency issues. The problem we are trying to solve is to not give the same key to two servers (as we donâ€™t want two URLs to have the same short key)

In our Key-DB, we can have 2 tables to store the keys, for:
1. `unused_keys`
2. `used_keys`

The reason we have 2 tables is to solve read concurrency issues. We are trying to avoid a situation where we give the same key to two application servers. Since there is only 1 KGS in the system at a time, there are inherently no write concurrency issues.

The KGS can always keep some unused keys in memory, so that whenever a server needs them, it can provide them quickly. As soon as the KGS loads some keys in memory, it moves them from `unused_keys` to `used_keys`, so that we can ensure each server gets unique keys. It's true that if the KGS goes offline, all those keys will be lost (and will still exist in the `used_keys` table). This is ok, since there are such a large amount of keys anyway.

Since the KGS would be a single point of failure, we can have a standby replica, and whenever the primary server dies it can take over to generate and provide keys.
