<p>Pipelines are the top-level component of continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.</p>
<p>A pipeline is a set of instructions (ie. <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/00Zg2MBUOK3gzRljklTOp">jobs</a>) that are executed in an order that we define</p>
<p>A merge request can have many pipelines, and each pipeline must belong to one merge request.</p>
<p>Normally a pipeline is created when you push to a branch on Gitlab</p>
<p>Pipelines comprise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jobs, which define what to do. For example, jobs that compile or test code.</li>
<li>Stages, which define when to run the jobs. For example, stages that run tests after stages that compile the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all jobs in a stage succeed, the pipeline moves on to the next stage.
If any job in a stage fails, the next stage is not (usually) executed and the pipeline ends early.</p>
<p>A typical pipeline might consist of four stages, executed in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>A build stage, with a job called compile.</li>
<li>A test stage, with two jobs called test1 and test2.</li>
<li>A staging stage, with a job called deploy-to-stage.</li>
<li>A production stage, with a job called deploy-to-prod.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pipelines come in various configurations</p>
<h3 id="basic-pipelines"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#basic-pipelines"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Basic pipelines</h3>
<p>run everything in each stage concurrently, followed by the next stage. Run the pipeline each time changes are pushed to a branch.</p>

<p>pipelines are based on relationships between jobs and can run more quickly than basic pipelines.</p>
<pre><code>- we achieve this with the `needs` keyword, which allows us to be explicit about the job's dependencies (ex. a post-install stage *needs* an install stage to have succeeded first)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="multi-project-pipelines"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#multi-project-pipelines"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Multi-project pipelines</h3>
<p>combine pipelines for different projects together.</p>
<h3 id="parent-child-pipelines"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#parent-child-pipelines"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Parent-Child pipelines</h3>
<p>break down complex pipelines into one parent pipeline that can trigger multiple child sub-pipelines, which all run in the same project and with the same SHA. This pipeline architecture is commonly used for mono-repos.</p>
<h3 id="pipelines-for-merge-requests"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#pipelines-for-merge-requests"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Pipelines for Merge Requests</h3>
<p>Run only when commits associated with an MR are pushed (rather than for every commit).</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge Request jobs run in a separate pipeline from Commit jobs.</li>
<li>These pipelines are labeled as <code>detached</code> in the UI</li>
</ul>
<p>Pipelines for merge requests can run when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new merge request.</li>
<li>Commit changes to the source branch for the merge request.</li>
<li>Select the Run pipeline button from the Pipelines tab in the merge request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can be configured with <code>rules</code> or <code>only/except</code></p>

<p>merge request pipelines that act as though the changes from the source branch have already been merged into the target branch.</p>

<p>Merge trains use pipelines for merged results to queue merges one after the other.</p>
