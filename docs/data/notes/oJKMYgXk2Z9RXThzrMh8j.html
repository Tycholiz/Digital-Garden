<p>a smoke test may address basic questions like "does the program run?", "does the user interface open?", or "does clicking the main button do anything?"</p>
<ul>
<li>"smoke tests broadly cover product features in a limited time. If key features don't work or if key bugs haven't yet been fixed, your team won't waste further time installing or testing"</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase smoke test comes from electronic hardware testing. You plug in a new board and turn on the power. If you see smoke coming from the board, turn off the power. You don't have to do any more testing.</p>
<p>The process of smoke testing aims to determine whether the application is so badly broken as to make further immediate testing unnecessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, smoke tests should run quickly, giving benefits of faster feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>A daily build and smoke test is among industry best practices</p>
<p>Smoke tests can be <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/QcWzOHyHncFR0mEygK4QU">functional tests</a> or <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/AQjiAvYdKm3JHmww0q2V6">unit tests</a>.</p>
