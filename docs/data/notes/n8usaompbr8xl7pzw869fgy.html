<p>A window is a way to chunk data so that it can be processed in a more effective way.</p>

<p>Elements are assigned to a window based on their timestamp.</p>
<ul>
<li>each window has a specified size </li>
<li>windows do not overlap with each other.</li>

</ul>
<p>Like tumbling windows, each window has a specified size.</p>
<p>Sliding windows allow you to configure how frequently a window is started.</p>
<ul>
<li>therefore, sliding windows can be overlapping if the slide is smaller than the window size, causing elements to be assigned to multiple windows.</li>
<li>ex. you could have windows of size 10 minutes that slides by 5 minutes. With this you get every 5 minutes a window that contains the events that arrived during the last 10 minutes as depicted by the following figure.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="session-window">Session Window<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#session-window"></a></h3>
<p>assigner groups elements by sessions of activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>do not overlap</li>
<li>do not have a fixed start and end time</li>
<li>Instead, a session window closes when it does not receive elements for a specified period of time (ie. when a gap of inactivity occurred).
<ul>
<li>When this period expires, the current session closes and subsequent elements are assigned to a new session window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="global-window">Global Window<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#global-window"></a></h3>
<p>With a global window scheme, all elements with the same key will be assigned to the same single global window</p>
