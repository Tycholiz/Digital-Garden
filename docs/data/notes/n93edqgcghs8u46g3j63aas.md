Graph databases are similar to [[document databases|db.type.document]], but add another layer (the relationship), which allows them to link documents for rapid traversal.

Graph databases excel at representing hierarchical relationships

Graph databases are very useful in 
- supply chain management
    - entities: suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, products, customers
    - relationships: supplier-to-manufacturer, manufacturer-to-distributor, distributor-to-customer
- pharmaceutical research
- log analysis
