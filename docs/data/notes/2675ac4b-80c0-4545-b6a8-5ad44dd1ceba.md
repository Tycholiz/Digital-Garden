Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data has been transferred through serial ports to devices such as modems, terminals, various peripherals, and directly between computers.
- Modern consumer PCs have largely replaced serial ports with higher-speed standards, primarily USB
- serial ports are still frequently used in applications demanding simple, low-speed interfaces, such as industrial automation systems, scientific instruments, point of sale systems and some industrial and consumer products.
- Server computers may use a serial port as a control console for diagnostics
