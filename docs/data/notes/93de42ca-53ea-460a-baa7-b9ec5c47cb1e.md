Technically, Linux is only a kernel. The [[operating system|os]] we run is Ubuntu, or Mint, or Debian etc.
- Linux can therefore be thought of as a family of operating systems, all connected by the fact that they all use the Linux kernel to perform backend functions.

The Linux kernel is versioned like this:

> 4.20.16-200.fc29.x86_64
- The first 3 bytes are [semver](https://semver.org/).
- `200` refers to bug fixes and patches in this release.
- `fc29.x86_64` refers to the distribution, here 64 bit version of Fedora 29.
