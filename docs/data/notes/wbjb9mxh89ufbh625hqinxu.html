<p>ext4 is a journaling file system for Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>A journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of changes not yet committed to the file system's main part by recording the goal of such changes in a data structure known as a "journal", which is usually a circular log. In the event of a system crash or power failure, such file systems can be brought back online more quickly with a lower likelihood of becoming corrupted</li>
<li>For example, deleting a file on a Unix file system involves three steps:
<ol>
<li>Removing its directory entry.</li>
<li>Releasing the inode to the pool of free inodes.</li>
<li>Returning all disk blocks to the pool of free disk blocks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ext4 filesystem can support volumes with sizes in theory up to 64 zebibyte (ZiB) and single files with sizes up to 16 tebibytes (TiB) with the standard 4 KiB block size, and volumes with sizes up to 1 yobibyte (YiB) with 64 KiB clusters, though a limitation in the extent format makes 1 exbibyte (EiB) the practical limit.</p>
<p>ext4 uses checksums in the journal to improve reliability, since the journal is one of the most used files of the disk.</p>
