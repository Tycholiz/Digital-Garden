<p>When a browser sends a request to a server, all of the cookies are automatically sent along with that request.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of using cookies versus local storage is that the server receives all of these cookies on initial request. If we are storing a JWT in local storage, then the user will be shown the non-authenticated version of the page initially. The reason is that local storage uses JavaScript, which only gets loaded after the HTML and CSS have been already received. This is a perceivable delay, over just storing the JWT in an http-only cookie.</p>
<p>If you use an HTTP only cookie for authentication, the user's data will be available on the server for the initial render</p>
