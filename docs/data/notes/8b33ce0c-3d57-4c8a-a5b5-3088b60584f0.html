<p>What if we want to force push, but don't want to run into problems if someone else has pushed to that branch in the meantime?
To get a warning when trying to force push to a branch that has been committed to in the meantime, run:
<code>git push --force-with-lease</code></p>

<li>Force pushing to feature branches is a fact of life. Force pushing to a <code>master</code> branch should be considered with extreme care.
<ul>
<li>Force pushing to feature branches allows us to have a clean history of commits on that feature branch. If we embrace <code>rebase</code>-<code>merge</code> instead of just <code>merge</code>, then we will encounter lots of scenarios where we must force push to that feature branch.
<ul>
<li>Note: this strategy should NOT be taken if multiple developers are working on the same branch. Rebase is not a good candidate for shared branches.</li>
