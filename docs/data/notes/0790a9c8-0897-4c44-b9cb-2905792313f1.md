### Local Vault
A local vault is a folder in your file system.

### Remote Vault
A remote vault is a git repository. If you choose a remote vault, you can choose from a vault from the registry or enter a custom git url.
- Note that when you add a remote vault, the url can also point to a remote workspace. In that case, dendron will inspect the dendron.yml to get a list of all vaults within the workspace and add all vaults from inside the workspace.
