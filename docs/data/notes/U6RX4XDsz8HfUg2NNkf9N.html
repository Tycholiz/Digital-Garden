<h1 id="merge-commit">Merge Commit<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#merge-commit"></a></h1>
<p>When git creates a merge commit it will also by default append a list of files that had conflicts to the commit message:</p>
<pre><code>Conflicts:
    src/foo-service.c
    src/bar-client.c
</code></pre>
<p>This is a piece of useful information for us when poring over the history to find out what went wrong</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if your merge conflict was trivial, there is always a non-zero chance of introducing a bug when resolving a conflict, and seeing those lines in the merge commit message could be valuable information. They are basically a hint saying “Still confused? Maybe you should be extra careful when reviewing the changes in these files”.</li>
</ul>
