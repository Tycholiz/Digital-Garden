### Why Testing Microservices is more complicated
You need a different strategy to test microservices as they follow a different architecture, and...
- have a lot of integrations with other microservices within oneâ€™s organisation as well as from the outside world (3rd party integrations). 
- require a high degree of inter-team collaboration 
- services are single purpose and are deployed independently & regularly.
