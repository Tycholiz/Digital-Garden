## Bridging
- A network bridge is a networking device that creates a single network from multiple networks.
	- This process is called *network bridging*
- Bridging differs from routing, since routing allows multiple networks to communicate independently and yet remain separate.
	- On the other hand, bridging connects two separate networks as if they were a single network
- Occurs at L2
