<p>All authorization should be handled by the business logic layer in the application, not in graphql</p>

<p>In a REST API, authentication is often handled with a header, that contains an auth token which proves what user is making this request. Express middleware processes these headers and puts authentication data on the Express request object. </p>
<p>There are two broad ways of handling authentication in GraphQL APIs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication via the GraphQL server</strong>: All users have to be logged in by the GraphQL server before they can query the endpointâ€”purely GraphQL workflows. Authentication is implemented in the GraphQL Schema
<ul>
<li>It involves first getting a JWT token, then passing that token in subsequent requests</li>
<li>this is the method proposed by Postgraphile (a JWT-based approach). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Authentication via a Web Server</strong> (ex. Express and Passport): Users can make queries to the GraphQL endpoint once they are logged in. Authentication is implemented with middleware.</li>
</ol>
