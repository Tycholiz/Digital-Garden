<h1 id="subquery">Subquery<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#subquery"></a></h1>
<p>Think of subqueries as fluent syntax that's chained by nesting rather than step by step after each other.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>similar to functional programming and how you read from the inside-out, using the output of the inner function as input for the next outer function </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>subqueries return a subset of data from a larger set of data (which arose from a different query)</p>
<ul>
<li>ie. perform a query to get some data, then immediately perform another query on that data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>subqueries can be used almost anywhere in an SQL query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if a subquery is slow, try and convert it to a derived table, as those are much faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subqueries can usually be executed independently, allowing us to see what each one is doing so we can mentally make substitutions as we are trying to understand an SQL query</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use subqueries any time you want to first query a set of data, which you will then query again on</p>
<ul>
<li>note: in reality it is not as inefficient as it sounds. This is just a simplification</li>
</ul>
<p>ex. below, if <code>dr_recommended</code> is a table with a column called <code>activity</code>, then this query will return all activities in both tables, since they will be "doctor recommended"
select the <code>type</code> column go in the <code>dr_recommended</code> table</p>
<ul>
<li>you can use the WITH clause in place of sub-queries</li>
</ul>

<p>ex. below, we first query for the highest joindate, then out of the subset of data, we query for the joindate, firstname and surname</p>
