<p>.NET is a framework that contains a large set of programs to be called from the program you are building. These functions/programs can be as simple as <em>join 2 arrays</em>, or can be as complex as <em>translate voice to text</em>/<em>recognize red object in an image</em>.</p>
<p>.NET is made up of an SDK and a runtime environment</p>
<p>the languages that are used in the framework can all be compiled down to a common language</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. C#, VB, IronPython (a .NET implementation of Python)</li>
</ul>
<p>The computers that run a .NET application need to have the corresponding .NET framework installed prior to being able to run it.</p>

<p>Common Language Runtime (CLR) – This allows the executions of programs written in the .NET framework using C#, VB, Visual C++</p>
<ul>
<li>also used to provide services such as memory management, security, exception handling, loading and executing of the programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Framework Class Library (FCL) – This is integrated with the CLR of the .NET framework and allows writing programs using .NET supporting programming languages such as C#, Visual C++, VB, etc.</p>
<p>User and Program Interfaces – This provides tools to develop desktop and windows applications. Windows forms, web services, Console applications and web forms are some examples of the user and program interfaces.</p>

<p>.NET is a (software) development platform that is used to develop, run and execute the applications</p>
<ul>
<li>unified environment is the key value adder of .NET</li>
</ul>
<p>ASP.NET is a web framework that is used to build dynamic web applications</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET is part of the .NET framework
<ul>
<li>because of this, developers have access to all of the .NET classes and features</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>applications developed by ASP.NET are largely component-based and built on the top of the common language runtime (CLR) and can be written in any of the .NET languages.</li>
</ul>
