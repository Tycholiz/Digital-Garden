<p>Edge compute is an architecture where compute and storage resources are decentralized and distributed</p>
<ul>
<li>for example it could mean compute environments are distributed all over the globe, located on every oil rig owned by an oil company or put into every truck in a fleet of food delivery vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of edge compute is to minimize the amount of raw, unprocessed data sent to/from applications operating at edge locations (think CCTV cameras, or digital signage) and to reduce the time it takes for instructions to be sent from a central server to devices located at the edge</p>
<ul>
<li>In an edge environment you can have sensors and devices talking directly to applications running on the network, with the application processing information in real time</li>
</ul>
