# Directives(`@`)
- Using variables, Directives let us dynamically change the structure and shape of our queries.
- This allows us to either `@include` or `@skip` over fields.
- ex. In Never Forget, consider the BrowseNugget screen. Our list component allows us to switch between just showing the nugget name, and showing a summary of the nugget. To determine whether or not we want the summary, we can use a variable:
```
query Nugget($details: details) {
	nugget {
		title
		mediaItems @include(if:  $details) {
			title
		}
	}
}
```
Directives are useful when we find ourselves needing to do string manipulation in order to modify (ie. add/remove fields from) our query structure.

To be Graphql spec-compliant, a server must implement only the `@include` and `@skip` directives. This leaves each server implementation open to extending their own directives.

### Use with Inline Fragments
Directives can also be applied with inline fragments like so:
```
query inlineFragmentNoType($expandedInfo: Boolean) {
  user(handle: "zuck") {
    id
    name
    ... @include(if: $expandedInfo) {
      firstName
      lastName
      birthday
    }
  }
}
```

### Deprecation
Fields in an object may be marked with the `@deprecated` directive like so:
```
type ExampleType {
  oldField: String @deprecated
}
```

These fields can still be queried (to prevent breaking changes).
