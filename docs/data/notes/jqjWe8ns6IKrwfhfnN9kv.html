<p>Actions are standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job
Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow. You can create your own actions, or use actions created by the GitHub community</p>
<p>For instance, we have the <code>checkout@v2</code> action, which allows the runner to checkout a repo. In fact, we can checkout any SHA from any repo.</p>
