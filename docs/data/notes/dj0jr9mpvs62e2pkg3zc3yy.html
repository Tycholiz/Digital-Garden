<p>A Jupyter kernel is a programming language-specific engine that executes the code contained in a Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>The kernel is what communicates between the Jupyter notebook and the Python interpreter.</p>
<ul>
<li>therefore, each kernel is tied to a specific python interpreter (e.g. the interpreter installed at <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.11</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Within Python itself, you can have different kernels for different conda environments.</p>

<p>If we have a PC with high performing GPU then we can run the Jupyter Server from that computer, and connect remotely to it from our work computer.</p>
