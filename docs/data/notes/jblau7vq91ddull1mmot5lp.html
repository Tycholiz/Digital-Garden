<p>The <code>declare</code> keyword is used to tell Typescript "this thing (usually a variable) exists already, and can therefore be referenced by other code".</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, it tells the Typescript compiler that there is no need to compile this statement into Javascript</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine our project calls some third party JS script which returns an object. Since Javascript has no typings, we would have no typing information on this object. <code>declare</code> gives us a mechanism through which we can say "trust me, this variable exists and has <em>this</em> type". The compiler will use this statement to statically check other code but will not trans-compile it into any JavaScript in the output.</p>
<ul>
<li>this enables our Typescript to be able to call, say, a method on that returned object, since we've typed it with the <code>declare</code> keyword.</li>
</ul>
