## What is an AST?
Think of an AST as a big nested object that holds metadata about the thing we are describing.
- ex. we could generate an AST of a single Javascript file. The AST would have a field called `body`, which is an array of parts: 
  - variable declaration 
  - expression statement 
  
Imagine we have an extremely short file `file.js`:
```js
const myname = 'jason'
console.log(myname)
```

The resulting AST of this file would be:
```json
{
  "type": "Program",
  "start": 0,
  "end": 43,
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "VariableDeclaration",
      "start": 0,
      "end": 22,
      "declarations": [
        {
          "type": "VariableDeclarator",
          "start": 6,
          "end": 22,
          "id": {
            "type": "Identifier",
            "start": 6,
            "end": 12,
            "name": "myname"
          },
          "init": {
            "type": "Literal",
            "start": 15,
            "end": 22,
            "value": "jason",
            "raw": "'jason'"
          }
        }
      ],
      "kind": "const"
    },
    {
      "type": "ExpressionStatement",
      "start": 23,
      "end": 42,
      "expression": {
        "type": "CallExpression",
        "start": 23,
        "end": 42,
        "callee": {
          "type": "MemberExpression",
          "start": 23,
          "end": 34,
          "object": {
            "type": "Identifier",
            "start": 23,
            "end": 30,
            "name": "console"
          },
          "property": {
            "type": "Identifier",
            "start": 31,
            "end": 34,
            "name": "log"
          },
          "computed": false,
          "optional": false
        },
        "arguments": [
          {
            "type": "Identifier",
            "start": 35,
            "end": 41,
            "name": "myname"
          }
        ],
        "optional": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "sourceType": "module"
}
```

ASTs are commonly used in compilers to parse the code we write, converting it into a tree structure that we can traverse programmatically.

Creating lint rules is another area we can make use of ASTs. The AST enables us to recognize certain parts of the code and act accordingly with our rules. 
- ex. The `no-unused-vars` looks at all `VariableDeclaration` types and ensures that the variable names are used at least once elsewhere in the code.

Syntax highlighting is made possible by ASTs
