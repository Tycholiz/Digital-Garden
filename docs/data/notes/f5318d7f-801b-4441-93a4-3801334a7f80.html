<p>Domain Driven Design is the concept that we should design our application code with heavy consideration into the business logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. we don't know if it will always be the case that you must be a user to purchase a book. Therefore, we shouldn't design the system in a way where we can't accomplish that easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>DDD is not about writing code in a certain way. Rather, it's about understanding the underlying logic behind the problems you need to solve. It's the thinking about domains that drives the design of the code. In a way, DDD is the opposite of jumping right in with code and trying to solve something without thinking about it beforehand. </p>
<ul>
<li>"The novice jumps in right away with code. The veteran ponders the problem they are solving, and thinks (in code) about the logic of that problem"</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the core ideas of DDD is Bounded Context: the subsystems of a business (business used loosely here). Consider that a business has many different contexts, and that there is interaction between them at certain interface points, like the sales context and the customer support context

<p>Because Bounded Context is a fundamental idea, the whole software project needs to be on board with the idea of DDD.</p>
<p>DDD is all about unifying all of the code in a way that is highly comprehensible to those uninvolved with the code's creation.</p>
