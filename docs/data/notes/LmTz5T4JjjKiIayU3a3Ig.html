<p>The default conversion from an object to string is <code>[object Object]</code></p>
<ul>
<li>when we see <code>[object Object]</code> somewhere, it would seem to imply that the object is getting coerced into a string somewhere along the line, thus resulting in us seeing <code>[object Object]</code> </li>
<li>check to see if you didn't properly stringify json</li>
<li>output from <code>console.log</code> is captured at the application level, meaning that we won't get access to the logs if we are using multiple applications
<ul>
<li>ex. if we are using Azure Functions in our app, we are using multiple applications, since our codebase exists in a different application than our Azure Functions. </li>
</ul>
</li>
