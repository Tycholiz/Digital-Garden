<p>space can be reused, while time can't.
"Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform."</p>

<p>a function describing the amount of memory that an algorithm takes in terms of input to the algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Space complexity is sometimes ignored because the space used is minimal and/or obvious, but sometimes it becomes as important an issue as time.</li>
</ul>
<p>ex. we might say "this algorithm takes constant extra space," because the amount of extra memory needed doesn't vary with the number of items processed.</p>

<p>a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Time" can mean...
<ul>
<li>the number of memory accesses performed,</li>
<li>the number of comparisons between integers,</li>
<li>the number of times some inner loop is executed,</li>
<li>or some other natural unit related to the amount of real time the algorithm will take.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We try to keep this idea of time separate from "wall clock" time, since many factors unrelated to the algorithm itself can affect the real time</li>
</ul>
<p>ex. we might say "this algorithm takes n2 time," where n is the number of items in the input.</p>

<p>anal: consider that if making one cup of ramen noodles takes 3 min, making 5 cups would take 15 min (3x5). Conversely, if I was going to make a beef stu, if one serving takes 50 min, 5 servings will still be roughly 50 min. This is the concept of time. Now consider, that ramen has a 1:1 relationship with space. In other words, if I am filling up a shopping cart, the amount of ramen that takes up space is directly proportional to the number of serving I have to make. 5 servings = 5 cups of ramen noodles. On the other hand, stu for 1 person or 5 will have a less linear relationship. This is the concept of space.</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to build algorithms that are more like the stu.

<p>And in mathematical terms...

The above shows how the left side of the equation is time/space, and the right side is the O Notation</p>
<p>Time and Space Complexity at this level describe the relationship between Inputs and rate of operations/space taken</p>

<p>Based on the above, ramen noodles have a time complexity of <code>O(n)</code>. In other words, their "growth" rates are linear, and each additional operator will add an a period of time that is equal to the average durations of each operator.</p>

<p>In general as your inputs increase your, time becomes greater at a certain greater rate which is related to the exponent, ^2 for quadratics, ^K for Polynomials and everything in between:
