DDNS is a method of automatically updating a nameserver in the Domain Name System with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information.
- each time your IP address changes, a program redirects the new address to the domain name and makes it permanently available on the internet.
DDNS solves the problem of having your public IP address change. Since getting a static public IP address from an ISP can be expensive, this is another solution to that problem.

The term is used to describe two different concepts
1. **dynamic DNS updating** - systems that are used to update traditional DNS records without manual editing
2. ?

DNS is only suitable for devices that don't change their IP often.
- DDNS is a system that addresses the problem of rapid updates.
