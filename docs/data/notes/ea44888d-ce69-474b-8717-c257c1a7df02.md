### Domain name registry
- a large database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the TLDs of the DNS
	- With a database, third party entities (companies) can request administrative control of a domain name.
- Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS.
- while registries manage domain names, they delegate the *reservation* of domain names to registrars
