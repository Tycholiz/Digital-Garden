<p>WASM is the answer to the question "how do we run languages other than Javascript in the browser?"</p>
<ul>
<li>any language can run as a WASM language</li>
</ul>
<p>Conceptually, what is happening is that there is a container within the browser that includes whatever runtime and language environment that we need, and it interfaces with a minimal amount of javascript that is running natively in the browser.</p>
<p>WASM becomes useful when there is an intense amount of computation happening in the browser</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Figma</li>
</ul>
