Arduino abstracts the circuit board part of electronics away from us, by giving us a pre-made integrated circuit
- Arduino allows us to perform logical computations
    - ex. When I press *this*, *that* happens

### Parts of Arduino
Hardware
1. a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), with contains the Integrated Circuit
2. Pin headers, so we can easily connect to other devices
3. USB port to connect to a computer

Software
1. IDE
