<p>A stash is simply a list of patches, that you can apply wherever you want.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take all modified tracked files (that are unstaged) and staged changes, and save them onto a stack of unfinished changes</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run git stash (alias of <code>git stash save</code>), git makes two commits that are not on any branch. </p>
<ol>
<li>One commit holds the state of the index, </li>
<li>the second commit holds state of the work tree.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>git stash</code> takes uncommitted changes, stores them internally, then runs <code>git reset --hard</code> to give us a clean working directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that stashes can be applied to any branch, useful if we ever discover that we were developing on the wrong branch.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><code>pop</code> will delete the stash after it is applied, while <code>apply</code> keeps it around for future use
<ul>
<li>this is why the below trick to revert the stash does not work if <code>pop</code> is used</li>
</ul>
</li>
