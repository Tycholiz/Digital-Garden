### Diode
- Diodes only allow current to flow in a single direction
	- This is done by having zero resistance in one direction, and very high resistance in the other.
- Diodes have 2 terminals, each of which is an electrode: an *anode* and a *cathode*
	- anodes allow current to flow in from outside a circuit
	- cathodes allow current to flow out of a polarized device.
