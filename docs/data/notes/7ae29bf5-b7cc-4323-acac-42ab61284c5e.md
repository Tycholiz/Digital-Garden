A stash is simply a list of patches, that you can apply wherever you want.
- Take all modified tracked files (that are unstaged) and staged changes, and save them onto a stack of unfinished changes

When you run git stash (alias of `git stash save`), git makes two commits that are not on any branch. 
1. One commit holds the state of the index, 
2. the second commit holds state of the work tree.

`git stash` takes uncommitted changes, stores them internally, then runs `git reset --hard` to give us a clean working directory.
- This means that stashes can be applied to any branch, useful if we ever discover that we were developing on the wrong branch.

### Apply vs Pop
- `pop` will delete the stash after it is applied, while `apply` keeps it around for future use
	- this is why the below trick to revert the stash does not work if `pop` is used
