<h1 id="udp">UDP<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#udp"></a></h1>
<p>UDP is a no-frills, lightweight transport protocol, providing minimal services.</p>
<p>UDP is connectionless, so there is no handshaking before the 2 processes start to communicate.</p>
<p>UDP is a fire-and-forget protocol</p>
<p>UDP is a disconnected protocol in which the recipient of a datagram doesn’t send any acknowledgment to the sender</p>
<p>UDP provides low-overhead and faster transmission, but with less reliability and ordered delivery.</p>
<p>UDP provides an unreliable data transfer service, meaning that when a process sends a message into a UDP <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">socket (Private)</a>, UDP provides no guarantee that the message will ever reach the receiving process. Furthermore, there is not even a guarantee that the messages will arrive in the order they were sent.</p>
<p>UDP does not perform flow control and does not retransmit lost packets like <a href="/notes/d2e2hSjyVoKd0AmH4P1Yj">TCP</a></p>
<p>UDP is a good choice in situations where delayed data is worthless. </p>
<ul>
<li>ex. in a VoIP phone call, there probably isn’t enough time to retransmit a lost packet before its data is due to be played over the speakers. In this case, there’s no point in retransmitting the packet.</li>
