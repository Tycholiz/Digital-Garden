<p>UDP is a no-frills, lightweight transport protocol, providing minimal services.</p>
<p>UDP is connectionless, so there is no handshaking before the 2 processes start to communicate.</p>
<p>UDP provides an unreliable data transfer service, meaning that when a process sends a message into a UDP <a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">socket (Private)</a>, UDP provides no guarantee that the message will ever reach the receiving process. Furthermore, there is not even a guarantee that the messages will arrive in the order they were sent.</p>
