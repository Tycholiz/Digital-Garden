## Mobile-first
`@media` queries should favor `min-width`
- Max-width queries come into play when you want styles to be constrained below a certain viewport size. A combination of both min-width and max-width media queries will help to constrain the styles between two different viewport sizes.

`min-width: 800px` => "these styles will apply once you hit 800px"
`max-width: 1200px` => "these styles no longer apply once you hit 1200px"
