There are 3 categories of bug origin in our code (LSD)
1. Logic - Are the steps you used to carry out the operation correct?
2. Syntax - Is what you are trying to portay in the code the right way to write it given the programming language being used?
3. Data - Is the data passing through in a way that you'd expected? Does the programmatic state of the program align with what you'd expect from your code?
