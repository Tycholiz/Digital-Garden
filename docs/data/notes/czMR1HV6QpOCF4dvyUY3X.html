<p>Minikube is a virtual machine that runs locally and has the necessary Kubernetes components deployed into it. The VM will get configured with Docker and Kubernetes via a single binary called localkube.</p>
<p>If we were using Docker Swarm (instead of Kubernetes), we'd be able to <code>docker swarm init</code> to create a local Docker Swarm Cluster. Minikube is a service that allows us to have this level of simplicity with Kubernetes</p>
<p>In Minikube, there's only 1 server that acts as both the master and the node</p>
