A data warehouse is a database optimized to analyze relational data coming from transactional systems and line of business applications.

The data structure, and schema are defined in advance to optimize for fast SQL queries, where the results are typically used for operational reporting and analysis.
- Data is cleaned, enriched, and transformed so it can act as the “single source of truth” that users can trust.

It differs from a [[data lake|storage.cloud.data-lake]] because it stores the data in a single format, whereas a data lake stores the data as-is (Postgres, Mongo etc.)
