<li>serverless compute engine for containers</li>
<li>adds about 20% in price, but removes a lot of the admin overhead</li>
<li>removes the need to provision and manage servers
<ul>
<li>don't have to worry about scaling, patching, securing, and managing servers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fargate automates how much computing power you need and will scale up/down automatically</li>
<li>with Fargate, you only interact with your containers

<h3 id="differences-with-ecs">Differences with ECS<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#differences-with-ecs"></a></h3>
<p>With a virtual machine, someone still has to manage the hardware, but with EC2 that someone is AWS and you never even see the hardware.</p>
<p>With ECS on EC2, someone still has to manage the instances, but with ECS on Fargate that someone is AWS and you never even see the EC2 instances.</p>
<p>ECS has a “launch type” of either EC2 (if you want to manage the instances yourself) or Fargate (if you want AWS to manage the instances).</p>
