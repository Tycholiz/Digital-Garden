# ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- running containers via AWS proprietary orchestrator
- There are 2 main models for running containers: ec2 and fargate
- ECS clusters can be run a few different ways:
	- run on vms
	- managed docker container runtime
	- EC2
	- Fargate
- **ECS Control Plane** - The tools to manage ECS
	- handles autohealing
- by default, containers behave like other Linux processes with respect to access to resources like CPU and memory. this means they get access to all of the host's CPU and memory capacity
  - ecs provides mechanisms through which we can limit this (in the task)

### Task
**Task definition** - To prepare your application to run on Amazon ECS, you create a task definition, which is a JSON file that describes between 1 and 10 containers
- Think of it as a blueprint for your application
- Task definition parameters might be:
	- Which containers should be used?
	- Which ports should be opened?
	- Which data volumes should be used within the containers?
	- How are container linked together

- a `task` is an instantiation of a `task definition`
	- the basic unit of deployment is a `task`
- a `task` is a logical construct that models 1+ containers
	- therefore, the ECS API operates on tasks rather than individual containers
- in ECS you run a task, which in turn runs a container
- each fargate task has its own isolation boundary and doesn't share kernel, cpu resources, memory resources etc

- **ECS Cluster** - a regional grouping of container instances, upon which we can run task requests
	- When tasks are run on Fargate, cluster resources are managed for us
	- ECS cluster is a regional grouping of one or more container instances on which you can run task requests
