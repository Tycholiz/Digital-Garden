<p>If you choose to use Aurora, you have the option of base Aurora, or Aurora serverless. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Base Aurora</em> is AWS's highly customized MySQL/Postgres compatible database that gives you the stability and performance of the commercial enterprise databases (SQL Server/Oracle) at the cost point of the leading open source databases (MySQL/Postgres). It is extremely scalable. You can use auto scaling of your read replicas so as your read traffic peaks, read replicas will scale out. Aurora is perfectly capable of handling the most demanding relation data workloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything running Aurora is a diverged fork of the underlying DB.</p>
