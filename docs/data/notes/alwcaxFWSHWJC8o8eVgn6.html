<p>A handler is a routine/function/method which is specialized in a certain type of data or focused on certain special tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>handler</em> a very generic term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event handler - Receives and digests events and signals from the surrounding system (e.g. OS or GUI).</li>
<li>Memory handler - Performs certain special tasks on memory.</li>
<li>File input handler - A function receiving file input and performing special tasks on the data, all depending on context of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is code that's associated with and triggered by the occurrence of a specific event, like an incoming message, a thrown exception, a signal sent to a process, a network I/O request completing, or a mouse click on a user interface element.</p>
