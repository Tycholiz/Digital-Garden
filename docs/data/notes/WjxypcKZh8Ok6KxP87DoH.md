## Expression
an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

There are two types of expressions: 
1. those that have side effects (such as assigning values) 
2. those that purely evaluate.

Any JavaScript expression is also a statement.

## Statement

The `;` character is used to separate statements in JavaScript code.

The most basic statement is a block statement, which is used to group statements. 
- Block statements are commonly used with control flow statements (`if`, `for`, `while`).
