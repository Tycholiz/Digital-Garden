<p>DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) is an email authentication technique that allows the receiver to check that an email was indeed sent and authorized by the owner of that domain. </p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore DKIM is supposed to reduce spoofing.</li>
<li>This is done by giving the email a digital signature. This DKIM signature is a header that is added to the message and is secured with encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the email receiver (or receiving system) determines that an email is signed with a valid DKIM signature, it is confident that nothing in the email (body, subject, attachments etc) has been modified.</p>
<p>DKIM signatures are validated on the server, and thus aren't visible to end users.</p>
