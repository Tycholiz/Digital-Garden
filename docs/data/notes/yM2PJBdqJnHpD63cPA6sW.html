<p>Regex is the art of defining a string format. This format could be as simple as a literal string (e.g. the word "email"), or it could be as complex as the pattern that an email address follows.</p>
<h3 id="the-eager-regex-engine">The Eager Regex engine<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-eager-regex-engine"></a></h3>
<p>Regex is eager, meaning it will always return the leftmost match even if there is a better match to be found later.</p>
<ul>
<li>put another way, the engine is “eager” to report a match.</li>
<li>ex. if we were looking for the word <code>cat</code> in the sentence "He captured a catfish for his cat.", it would match the substring "cat" of the whole word "catfish", even though there is a single word "cat" at the end of the sentence. This shows how the regex engine returns the leftmost match; not the best match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine we used an alternation to match one of multiple strings: <code>Get|GetValue|Set|SetValue</code>. Because</p>
<ol>
<li>The engine walks through the regex, attempting to match the next token (ie. character or character class) in the regex to the next character.</li>
<li>If a match is found, the engine advances through the regex and the subject string.</li>
<li>If a token fails to match, the engine backtracks to a previous position in the regex and the subject string where it can try a different path through the regex.</li>
</ol>
<p>A regex engine always returns the leftmost match, even if a “better” match could be found later:</p>
<ol>
<li>When applying a regex to a string, the engine starts at the first character of the string.</li>
<li>It tries all possible permutations of the regular expression at the first character.</li>
<li>Only if all possibilities have been tried and found to fail, does the engine continue with the second character in the text.</li>
<li>Again, it tries all possible permutations of the regex, in exactly the same order. The result is that the regex engine returns the leftmost match.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider that Regex can be used to implement business logic. For instance, consider the following Regex:</p>
<pre><code>[0-9]{1,2}(\.\d+)? MB
</code></pre>
<p>This Regex will match <code>25 MB</code>, <code>3 MB</code>, <code>7.45 MB</code>, but not <code>100 MB</code>. By using <code>{1,2}</code>, we've limited our search to matches that are less than 100 MB.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pattern</code> - the regex text that we type into the search field</li>
<li><code>match</code> - any text in the document that is highlighted as a result of the search</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>While there are many implementations of regex that differ sometimes slightly, there are basically only two kinds of regular expression engines: text-directed engines, and regex-directed engines, with nearly all modern regex flavors are based on regex-directed engines</p>
<ul>
<li>certain very useful features, such as lazy quantifiers, backreferences, atomic grouping, possessive quantifiers etc., can only be implemented in regex-directed engines.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "normal" regex is Perl-Compatible Regex (PCRE)</p>
<ul>
<li>may be contrasted with Basic Regular Expressions (BRE)</li>
<li>Vim Regex largely follows BRE</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between the two is that BRE tends to treat more characters as literals - an "a" is an "a", but also a "(" is a "(", not a special character - and so involves more backslashes to give them "special" meaning.</p>
<h4 id="bre">BRE<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#bre"></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>\V</code> Verbatim Switch - only <code>\</code> has special meaning (ie. very nomagic)</p>
<ul>
<li>prevent regex symbols from taking over - <code>/\Va.k.a</code> (equivalent to <code>/a\.k\.a\.</code>)</li>
<li>in regex, <code>.</code> means "match any character". making a verbatim search removes that functionality</li>
<li>when we use <code>\V</code>, it means for the following search, only <code>\</code> will have a special meaning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>\v</code> Literal Switch - all characters (except word characters (<strong>[a-zA-Z_]</strong>)) have special meaning (ie. very magic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delimit words - since the word "the" appears in "these", if we wanted to just search for the word "the", we can use delimiters: <code>/\v&#x3C;the></code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ignore case - <code>/search\c</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enforce case - <code>/search\C</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terms">Terms<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#terms"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>magic</strong> means we don't have to escape a character for it to take on its special meaning. </li>
<li><strong>nomagic</strong> means we have to escape, because otherwise the character will be taken literally
<ul>
<li><em>ex.</em> with magic, <code>.</code> will mean "stand in for any character". with nomagic, it will literally mean "match the <code>.</code> character"</li>
<li>this verbiage makes sense, because with magic, a lot of cool stuff is happening, but we have no idea how it's being done. Without magic, it's just looking for a character</li>
</ul>
