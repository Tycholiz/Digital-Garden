<p>A program claims a portion of memory to perform its work. When it no longer needs that memory, it releases it so it can be reused (normally by the same program). When a program "forgets to" forfeit that memory, it builds up, resulting in a memory leak.</p>
<p>The main cause for leaks in garbage collected languages are unwanted references.</p>
