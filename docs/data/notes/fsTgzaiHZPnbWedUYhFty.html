<p>ElasticBeanstalk is a PaaS that enables you to deploy and scale applications onto Amazon EC2. You retain ownership and full control over the underlying EC2 instances.</p>
<p>Purpose is to deploy + scale web apps/services built with common web languages (Javascript, PHP etc) onto webservers like Nginx/Apache</p>
<ul>
<li>Elastic beanstalk hosts all the services needed for deployment/scaling</li>
</ul>
<p>ElasticBeanstalk uses <a href="/notes/NbGOJJpZuEbf0hXs2UvAB">CloudFormation</a> under the hood to manage and provision resources for your application.</p>
<p>ElasticBeanstalk Handles things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provisioning EC2 instances and scaling up/down as necessary</li>
<li>loadbalancing</li>
<li>updating platform with latest patches</li>
<li>app health monitoring</li>
<li>Web server (Nginx)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also allows us to reimplement portions of the code as containerized services, allowing us to achieve a more <a href="/notes/vutujFFWxQu6TshWVuMpI">distributed</a> architectural design</p>
<p>Allows to retain control over the resources powering your application, so you can decide on how much you want to manage.</p>
<p>To get an app working through ElasticBeanstalk, we essentially...</p>
<ol>
<li>upload source code bundle to Elastic Beanstalk console</li>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk returns a new URL for the webapp</li>
</ol>
