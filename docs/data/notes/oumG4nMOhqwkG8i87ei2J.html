<ul>
<li>PubSub is inherently asynchronous. Your test canâ€™t just make an API request and then perform an assertion on the response.</li>
<li>EventBridge has no persistent storage of events that you can query via its API.</li>
<li>How do you control the side effects caused by multiple downstream subscribers when publishing to EventBridge from your tests?</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to test for 3 main scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publisher fails to send event to EventBridge</li>
<li>Subscriber does not receive event that it should have</li>
<li>Subscriber receives event but fails to process it correctly</li>
</ul>
