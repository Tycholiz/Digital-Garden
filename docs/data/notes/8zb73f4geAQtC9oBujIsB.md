##### Re-execute the last search pattern (`/`)
`gn`
- This puts us in v-mode. If we type `gn` again, it will highlight until the next occurrence of that pattern
- `gn` is a text-object representing the last searched word
	- leverage this with `cgn` to replace the next occurrence of the search pattern
