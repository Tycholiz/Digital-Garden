*"Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form. Typography is clothing for words"*
- Type needs to be designed at:
    - the macro, page-level, considering the overall structure of the page the typographic hierarchy
    - and at the micro text-level, considering the details
        - spacing, what words get bolded to draw focus.
- Consider typographic pairings, a bold sans-serif typeface for headings catches the eye, coupling this with a classic serif for body copy helps aid legibility
- to pair typefaces, find a ‘superfamily’ and build around that
    - Consider contrasting typefaces for headings and body copy
    - generally serif for body, and sans-serif for heading
