<p>If playing lots of harmonics, you'll want a lot of treble in the tone.</p>
<p>If playing fast note runs with a relatively clean tone, too much treble exposes the weakness in playing, and rolling it off a bit can help make the performance sound better.</p>
<h3 id="overdrive">Overdrive<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#overdrive"></a></h3>
<p>There are 2 distinct types of overdrive: </p>
<ul>
<li>the kind generated by the pre-amp (where gain and tone controls live), and is characterized by a fuzzy sound quality. </li>
<li>the kind generated by overdriving the power amp (where the master volume control lives). This type of overdrive sounds more musical, with the guitar still feeling responsive with all the sustain you need, but with a smooth timbre and none of the buzzy abrasiveness of pre-amp distortion.
<ul>
<li>valve amps are prized for their power amp distortion, which are responsible for most of the classic rock tones</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make solos sound a little more clearly, boost the mids.</p>
<p>“Volume knob” is a bit of a misnomer</p>
<ul>
<li>If your amp is on a clean setting then the volume knob does pretty much what it says. However, in a more overdriven context, volume also increases the fatness of what’s being played.</li>
<li>however it does also apply in a clean context. Imagine we’re trying to get a nice clean tone, so we turn off the overdrive and use the neck pickup, but now the guitar sounds overly boomy. If you back off the volume a bit you’ll notice that it thins out the tone. </li>
</ul>
