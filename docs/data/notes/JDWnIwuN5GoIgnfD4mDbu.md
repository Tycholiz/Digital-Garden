## makeExtendSchemaPlugin
Allows us to extend the graphql schema that is generated by Postgraphile
- It does this by allowing us to define additional Graphql Types and Resolvers and merge them into our schema.
- To accomplish this, the callback we pass to `makeExtendSchemaPlugin` should return the `typeDefs` (schema definition) and the `resolvers` function

### typeDefs
This allows us to specify how our Graphql schema will be extended.
- ex. Will we be adding a new subscription on it? A new InputType?

### build
The `build` argument to the `makeExtendSchemaPlugin` contains information and helpers defined by various plugins in the Postgraphile ecosystem
- most importantly, it includes:
	1. introspection results (`build.pgIntrospectionResultsByKind`)
	2. inflection functions (`build.inflection`)
	3. an SQL helper (`build.pgSql`, an instance of `pg-sql2`

### selectGraphQLResultFromTable
This helper populates data that is returned from our resolver
- It should *not* be used to retrieve data for our resolver to process.
	- Instead use `context.pgClient` directly.

This helper should not be called more than once per resolver (which wouldn't make sense anyway)
