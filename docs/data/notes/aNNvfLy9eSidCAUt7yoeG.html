<p>lightweight file system like FAT32, but without the extra features and overhead of NTFS</p>
<ul>
<li>not as compatible as plain FAT, but much more compatible than NTFS</li>
<li>Assuming every device we may want to mount to is compatible with exFAT, this is the filesystem we should probably use.</li>
</ul>
