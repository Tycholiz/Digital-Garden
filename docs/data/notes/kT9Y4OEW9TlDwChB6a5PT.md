Decentralized computing is the allocation of resources (both hardware and software) to each individual machine.

Nowadays, most business computing requirements are trivial operations for a computer to perform. As a result, most desktop computers would remain idle for a significant portion of time, if we were taking a more traditional centralized approach. A decentralized system can use the potential of these systems to maximize efficiency.

Decentralized means that there is no single point where the decision is made. Every node makes a decision for itâ€™s own behaviour and the resulting system behaviour is the aggregate response, which would result from a single server if this was a centralized system.

In decentralized systems, there are many machines that each store a copy of the same resources that users can access. This allows us key benefits:
- It allows us to place edge nodes closer to users, thereby improving performance to them.
- It allows us to be more [[fault tolerant|deploy.distributed.fault-tolerance]]. If several nodes fail, extant ones may pick up the slack and allow the system to remain functional.
