<h1 id="gitignore">Gitignore<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#gitignore"></a></h1>
<p>When git comes across a file in your repo that is untracked, it will report it to you (in <code>git status</code>). However, if that file has been added to <code>.gitignore</code>, it will suppress it.</p>
<ul>
<li>once a file is known to git (ie. it has been in the index), adding the file to <code>.gitignore</code> has no effect (ie. the file will continue to be tracked)</li>
</ul>
<p>if you need to stop tracking a file (for example, we've already added the file to the index, but now want to start ignoring it), we need to run <code>git rm --cached &#x3C;file></code></p>
<ul>
<li>for folders, <code>git rm -r --cached &#x3C;folder></code></li>
</ul>
