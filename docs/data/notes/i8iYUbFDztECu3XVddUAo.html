<p>A registry is an organization responsible for maintaining a top-level zoneâ€™s datafiles, which contain the delegation to each subdomain of that top-level domain.</p>
<p>The DNS registry is a large database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the TLDs of the DNS</p>
<pre><code>- With a database, third party entities (companies) can request administrative control of a domain name.

<ul>
<li>Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS.</li>
<li>while registries manage domain names, they delegate the <em>reservation</em> of domain names to registrars</li>
</ul>
<p>any given top-level domain can have no more than one registry</p>

<p>A registrar acts as an interface between customers and registries</p>
<p>Once a customer has chosen a subdomain of the top-level zone, the registrar submits to the appropriate registry the zone data necessary to delegate that subdomain to the nameservers the customer specified.</p>
<p>The registries act, more or less, as wholesalers of delegation in their top-level zone. The registrars then act as retailers, usually reselling delegation in more than one registry.</p>

<p>Registration is the process by which a customer tells a registrar which nameservers to delegate a subdomain to and provides the registrar with contact and billing information.</p>
