<p>With an interactive rebase workflow, the idea is to create small commits as you go along, atomic enough that you can describe it in one line. For a given PR you might end up with 30 commits. If along the way you make mistakes, for instance you forget to rename something during an earlier commit when you renamed a variable in multiple places, you should just make a <code>fix</code> commit. Later on when you are ready to put your code up for PR, you can do an interactive rebase and move commits around, such as squashing the missed rename into the first commit that was supposed to do that.</p>
