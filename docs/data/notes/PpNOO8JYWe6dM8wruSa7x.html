<h3 id="default-heuristic">Default Heuristic<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#default-heuristic"></a></h3>
<p>Instead of searching for the best option, use a technique we call the default heuristic. The premise of this heuristic is that when the cost of acquiring new information is high and the consequence of deviating from a default choice is low, sticking with the default will likely be the optimal choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be any option that gives you very high confidence that it will work.</li>
<li>It is something you’ve used before.</li>
<li>Something you understand well.</li>
<li>Something that has proven itself to be a reliable way for getting things done in the space you’re operating in.</li>
<li>It doesn’t necessarily have to be the theoretical best choice.</li>
<li>It doesn’t have to be the most efficient. Or the latest and greatest.</li>
<li>It simply needs to be a reliable option to get you to your ultimate desirable outcome.</li>
<li>It should be very unlikely to fail you; you have to be confident that it’s a very safe bet. In fact, that’s the only requirement.</li>
</ul>
