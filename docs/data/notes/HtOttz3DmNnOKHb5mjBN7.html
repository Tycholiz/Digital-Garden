<p>A Resource group is a logical container for related resources. We would group together resources that we want to manage together as a group.</p>
<ul>
<li>all resources in a RG should be a part of the same lifecycle, meaning we deploy, update, and delete them together.</li>
<li>resource groups can be stored in a different location than the resource that is comprises. This is possible because the location of the RG is merely the location of the RGs metadata about its resources.</li>
<li>created with command <code>az group create</code></li>
<li>ex. <code>AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg</code></li>
</ul>

<p>From within resource panel (ie. database panel) of the resource group, select <code>connection security</code> and add your IP address</p>
