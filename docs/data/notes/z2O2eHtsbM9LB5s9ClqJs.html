<h1 id="tag"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#tag"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Tag</h1>
<p>Simply a way to mark specific commits as special in some way (ex. tag a specific commit as a specific release, or something along those lines)</p>
<ul>
<li>tags and branches are similar, in that they both point to a specific commit (ie. they are pointers to snapshots). Theoretically, branches could perform the role of tags. We could just keep around a branch called <em>Release 2.0</em>. Instead, Git allows us to separate concerns.
<ul>
<li>A branch is a moveable pointer to a snapshot, while tags point at a single snapshot and never move. Also, tags are actually stored as objects, while branches are not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if we are doing something a little risqu√© (like undoing a rebase), it's good to make a backup <code>git tag BACKUP</code>. Then if we ever need to go back to it, run <code>git reset --hard BACKUP</code></li>
</ul>

<p>There are 2 types of tag, lightweight and annotated</p>
<ul>
<li><em>lightweight</em> - a reference to a commit that never moves
<ul>
<li>this type of tag does not create a tag object</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>annotated</em> - when we create an annotated tag, Git creates a tag object and then writes a reference point to it (rather than directly to the commit).
<ul>
<li>we usually want this one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inner"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#inner"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Inner</h3>
<ul>
<li>The fourth (and less integral) object functions similar to a commit object, in that it contains a tagger, a message, a date, and a pointer.
<ul>
<li>The main difference is that a tag normally points to a commit rather than a tree. In this sense it is similar to a branch reference, but it never moves (ie. it always points to the same commit).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
