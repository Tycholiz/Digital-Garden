<h1 id="vfs-virtual-file-system">VFS (Virtual File System)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vfs-virtual-file-system"></a></h1>
<p>a component of the kernel</p>
<ul>
<li>handles all system calls related to files and file systems</li>
<li>serves as an interface between a user and a particular file system
<ul>
<li>In other words, it abstracts away the specific filesystem implementation and let's us access it on a command line.</li>
<li>it accomplishes this by specifying an interface (a contract) between the kernel and the underlying FS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we interact with the underlying FS by using the API provided by the VFS. </li>
<li>this abstraction allows us to bridge the differences between Windows filesystems, Mac filesystems, and Unix filesystems</li>
<li>when an external device attached to the system (such as a USB stick), Unix can run the <code>mount</code> command, which will create a new directory on the VFS.</li>
</ul>
