### `jest.fn()`
Allows us to mock a function

Used when we want to mock a function, and don't really care about its original implementation (often just mocking the return value)
- returns a `spy` (which remembers each call that was made on it)
- creates a stub
- useful in removing dependencies to some backend (eg. server, API)

If we pass an argument, then it means we are passing a mock implementation:

```js
const queryMock = jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ data: 1 })
console.log(queryMock()) // Promise { pending }
```

### `jest.spyOn(object, methodName)`
Creates a mock function like `jest.fn`, but also tracks calls to the method, allowing us to spy on them
- this allows to ensure that the functions are called as expected (e.g. with correct arguments)

spies still call the original code, they arenâ€™t complete mocks. They are called spies because they "spy" on the implementation code.

```ts
jest.spyOn(AutomationsDataSource.prototype, 'deleteAutomation').mockResolvedValue()
```

Or, we can add conditional logic:
```ts
jest.spyOn(AutomationsDataSource.prototype, 'getAutomation').mockImplementation((id) => {
  let automation: Automation
  switch (id) {
    case a1.id:
      automation = a1
      break
    case a2.id:
      automation = a2
      break
    default:
      automation = undefined
  }
  return Promise.resolve(automation)
})
```

We can also mock as many methods as we want:
```ts
jest.spyOn(AutomationsDataSource.prototype, 'getAutomation', 'deleteAutomation').mockImplementation((id) => {
// ...
```

### `jest.mock()`
`jest.mock` allows us to mock an entire module

If we call `jest.mock` with only 1 arg,
- the module we pass will be replaced simply with `jest.fn`

If we call `jest.mock` with 2 args,
- the module we pass will be replaced with the return value of the function provided (arg2).
    - in other words, if there is 2 args, `jest.mock` says "replace all occurrences of arg1 with arg2"

This code tells jest, "any time `calculateAge` is called, stick in 42 as its return value"
- we say "any time you import `calculateAge` into some other module, replace its value with `jest.fn(() => 42)`
```js
jest.mock('../calculateAge', () => {
  return jest.fn(() => 42);
});

// This runs the function specified as second argument to `jest.mock`.
const calculateAge = require('../calculateAge');
calculateAge(); // Will return '42';
```

#### Example
```ts
jest.mock('../components/box.jsx', () => 'Box')
```
- this is saying "for the component we are testing, take all instances of the `Box` component and replace them with the text `Box`"
- what's happening underlying is that since components are just functions, we are saying "replace our component function with the function `() => 'Box'`"
- we do this when we don't really care about all the props that come with box, but are just interested in the structure. `<Box />` doesn't really matter, since that isn't what we are testing.
- we do this basically when our proptypes fails, because we aren't supplying data in the way proptypes would expect (ex. passing to `Box` margin as `25px` rather than the expected `25`)

When we do `jest.mock('./my-file.js')`, it will turn all functions into Jest mock functions and all objects will have more properties on them like, `mockReturnValueOnce`

spec: Mocks get hoisted, so if there is a variable you define *after* the mock, you probably won't be able to use it

```js
jest.mock('./isValidCoupon', () => ({
    // isValidCoupon: async () => true,
    isValidCoupon: jest.fn().mockImplementation(async () => true),
}))
```

### Mocking individual functions
Imagine our implementation code file is made up of individually exported functions, and we want to mock one of them. We can use `jest.requireActual` to import the original implementation, but mock individual functions:
```ts
jest.mock('./automationVersions', () => {
  const origModule = jest.requireActual('./automationVersions')
  return {
    ...origModule,
    doesDraftExist: jest.fn(),
  }
})
```

Then, in our unit test we can mock the return value:
```ts
const mockedDoesDraftExist = jest.mocked(doesDraftExist)
mockedDoesDraftExist.mockReturnValue(true)
```
