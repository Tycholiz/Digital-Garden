<p>A tracking pixel is also known as a <em>web beacon</em></p>
<p>It is a lightweight piece of HTML that is included in a third-party website in order to grant us more visibility into how users interact with the site.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-does-it-work"></a></h2>
<p>The pixel itself is a 1 x 1 (ie. 1-pixel) image.</p>
<ul>
<li>the fact that the pixel is an <code>&#x3C;img></code> is vital. When a webpage loads and an <code>&#x3C;img></code> tag is encountered, it will send a GET request to the host company's web server (known as the <em>beacon web server</em>) to get the image. In that request is included varying identifying information about the requester, allowing the host to keep track of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The identifying information provided by the user's computer typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>the time the request was made</li>
<li>the type of web browser or email reader that made the request</li>
<li>the existence of cookies previously sent by the host server</li>
</ul>
<p>The host server can store all of this information, and associate it with a session identifier or tracking token that uniquely marks the interaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using a Javascript-based API call, the information is sent in the parameters of the image GET request and in the HTTP headers themselves.
<ul>
<li>as a result, we can include the pixel in any component that supports HTML.</li>
</ul>
