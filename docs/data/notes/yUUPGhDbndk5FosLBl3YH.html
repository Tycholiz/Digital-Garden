<p>A Deque (pronounced "Deck") is a Double-ended queue, meaning elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).</p>
<p>The basic operations on a deque are enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove) on either end.</p>
<p>Deques are normally implemented with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A modified dynamic array that can grow from both ends
<ul>
<li>which has time-complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for all operations except insertion/deletion in middle, which is <code>O(n)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A doubly linked list
<ul>
<li>which has time-complexity of <code>O(1)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
