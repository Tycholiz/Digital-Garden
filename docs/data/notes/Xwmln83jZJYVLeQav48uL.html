<p>A RAID is simply multiple physical hard drives acting as a single virtual hard drive</p>
<ul>
<li>RAID provides redundancy across several disks attached to the same machine</li>
</ul>
<p>The main goals of RAID are to safeguard your data with some sort of backup/failsafe, or to speed up reading/writing.</p>
<ul>
<li>When data is read, it is read from both hard drives and checked to make sure they agree.</li>
</ul>
<p>RAID bases its storage creation on the smallest drive in the storage pool. As shown in the below image, if the smallest drive in a classic RAID storage pool is 500 GB, all other drives in the storage pool can each only contribute 500 GB. As a result, the storage pool ends up with 2 TB of usable storage and 4.5 TB of wasted storage.</p>

</ul>
<p>There are 3 main types (with example of storing a song):</p>
<ol>
<li><em>RAID-0</em> - the song is stored across multiple hard drives. Therefore, if one fails then the file is corrupted 
<ul>
<li>Least safe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>RAID-1</em> - all hard drives have the same data. Therefore, if one fails, the redundancy provided by the second will allow us to retain all of the data.
<ul>
<li>RAID-1 is where disk mirroring is most commonly used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>RAID-5</em> - the song is stored across multiple hard drives (like RAID-0), but each hard drive will have its own backup. If one hard drive fails, the backup is restored so we don't get a corrupted file. 
<ul>
<li>This is the safest, but also more expensive and a bit slower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
