<ul>
<li>A RAID is simply multiple physical hard drives acting as a single virtual hard drive</li>
<li>The two main reasons are to safeguard your data with some sort of backup/failsafe, or to speed up reading/writing.
<ul>
<li>When data is read, it is read from both hard drives and checked to make sure they agree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are 3 main types (with example of storing a song):
<ol>
<li><em>RAID-0</em> - the song is stored across multiple hard drives. Therefore, if one fails then the file is corrupted 
<ul>
<li>Least safe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>RAID-1</em> - all hard drives have the same data. Therefore, if one fails, the redundancy provided by the second will allow us to retain all of the data.
<ul>
<li>RAID-1 is where disk mirroring is most commonly used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>RAID-5</em> - the song is stored across multiple hard drives (like RAID-0), but each hard drive will have its own backup. If one hard drive fails, the backup is restored so we don't get a corrupted file. 
<ul>
<li>This is the safest, but also more expensive and a bit slower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
