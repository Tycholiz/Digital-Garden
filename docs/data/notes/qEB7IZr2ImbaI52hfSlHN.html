<p>Type assertions helps you to force types when you are not in control of them. For e.g. -</p>
<ol>
<li>you are processing user data (with unreliable types)</li>
<li>working with data that has changed shape over years (employee code was numeric, now it is alphanumeric :))</li>
<li>receiving data from an external program</li>
</ol>
<p>Type assertions let the Typescript compiler know that a given variable should be treated as belonging to a certain type. There are no “exceptions” or data restructuring associated with assertions, except minimal validations (we refer this behaviour as “validations that are applied statically”).</p>
<p>There are two ways to do type assertions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bracket syntax. e.g. <code>let length: number = (&#x3C;string>lengthField);</code></li>
<li>Use as. e.g. <code>let length: number = lengthField as string;</code>
There is no difference between the two ways and the end result is always the same. Note that if you are using JSX you have to use <code>as</code> syntax.</li>
</ol>
