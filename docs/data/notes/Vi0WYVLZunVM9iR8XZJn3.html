<p>PDFs are popular in part because the creator can put locks on the document, allowing them to prevent you from doing things like copy the text or edit the fields without having been authenticated first.</p>
<p>You can get through a locked PDF relatively easily. There is a software called CutePDF Printer for Windows, and if you run the PDF through it, the lock will effectively be removed.</p>
