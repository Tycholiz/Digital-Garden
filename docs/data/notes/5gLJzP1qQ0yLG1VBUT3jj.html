<h1 id="head">HEAD<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#head"></a></h1>
<p>HEAD is the pointer that points to the latest commit on the currently checked out branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Therefore the HEAD is what lets Git know which commit will be the parent for the next commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>spec: While a branch simply points to a commit, a HEAD simply points to a branch (or a commit). If it points to a commit, it is because the commit is not at the tip of its branch, resulting in a detached HEAD.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recall that when HEAD does not coincide with the tip of any branch, the result is a detached HEAD. From Git's point of view, this simply means that HEAD doesn't contain a local branch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under normal circumstances, HEAD points to the branch we currently have checked out. However, we can also checkout a commit. Interestingly, we can checkout the same commit that our branch points to (which would be a detached head). In this case, both working trees would be identical. </p>
<p>Normally, the HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the currently checked out branch. We can see this by logging out the contents of <code>.git/HEAD</code></p>
<ul>
<li>here, symbolic reference means that it contains a pointer to another reference.</li>
</ul>
