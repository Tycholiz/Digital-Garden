Indirection is the ability to refer to something through use of a *reference* (id). Normally, this involves manipulating the variable in question by using a pointer. Pointers exist to provide reference to an object (called indirection node)
- *"All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection"*
- When the complexity of information becomes too much at one level, we simplify it with a layer of indirection that pushes the bulk of the complexity to a new level.
