<p>Objection is a relational query builder. </p>
<ul>
<li>get all the benefits of an SQL query builder but also a powerful set of tools for working with relations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="parts">Parts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#parts"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>define models declaratively, and map the relationship between models (1:many etc)</li>
<li>QueryBuilder - Every method that allows you to fetch or modify items in the database returns an instance of the QueryBuilder
<ul>
<li>therefore most important component in Objection</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All instance methods start with the character $ to prevent them from colliding with the database column names.</p>
<h3 id="model">Model<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#model"></a></h3>
<p>consider that in an app, there are different layouts of data:</p>
<ol>
<li>it could be the layout that exists in the database itself</li>
<li>it could be the layout that exists when the user gets that data back from the database (ie, on the client)
therefore, any time we read or write to a database, we are converting data</li>
</ol>
<p>there are 4 methods on a model that are used to transform data. They exist by default, but can be overridden.
these "converter methods" will be called each time data is tranformed: </p>
<ol>
<li>when we are writing data, we are converting it to the database layout, therefore <code>$formatDatabaseJson</code></li>
<li>when we are reading data, we are converting it to our internal data layout, therefore <code>$parseDatabaseJson</code></li>
<li>when we give data for a query, (for example <code>query().insert(req.body)</code>) or create a model explicitly using <code>model.fromjson(obj)</code> the <code>$parsejson</code> method is invoked
<ul>
<li>When you call <code>model.toJSON()</code> or <code>model.$toJson()</code> the <code>$formatJson</code> is called.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Note: Most libraries like express and koa automatically call the toJSON method when you pass the model instance to methods like response.json(model). You rarely need to call toJSON() or $toJson() explicitly.</li>
<li>All properties that start with $ are also removed from database and external layouts.</li>
</ul>
