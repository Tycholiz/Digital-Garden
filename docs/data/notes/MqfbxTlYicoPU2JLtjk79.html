<p>To undo a merge, simply run <code>git reset --hard HEAD</code></p>
<ul>
<li>by default, only the index will be reset, meaning the partially merged files will remain in the working directory.</li>
<li>If we've merged and committed already but want to revert the merge, we can discard the commit with <code>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD</code></li>
</ul>
<p>From a DX standpoint, the big difference between rebase and merge is that <code>merge</code> will preserve the "railroad" switch that was our branch when we look at the history, whereas <code>rebase</code> will show it linear.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Should this branch remain visible in the graph?"</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-to-use-merge">When to use Merge<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#when-to-use-merge"></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>If master remained untouched while we were working on our feature branch (in which case a fast-forward merge would be automatic).</li>
<li>When we have work that is related to an agile ticket or bugfix (which would allow us to look back in history and clearly see it)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#terminology"></a></h2>
<p>The <code>ours</code> <code>theirs</code> terminology is from the perspective of the "already existing branch". Put another way, if we are on main and merging in a feature branch, main is <code>ours</code> and feature is <code>theirs</code>. Also in the same way (and using a different paradigm), <code>current change</code> would refer to main, and <code>incoming change</code> to feature.</p>
<p>This is also the same as with rebase. if we are rebasing main onto feature, then <code>ours</code> will refer to main (<code>git rebase main</code> from feature branch)</p>
