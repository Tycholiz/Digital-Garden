<p>SOA is kind of a precursor to microservices. Microservices solved a lot of issues that SOA had, such as their heavy weight.</p>
<p>SOA is well suited in an environment where services are provided between software components using a communication protocol (like HTTP).</p>
<p>Service orientation is a way of thinking in terms of services and the outcomes of those services.</p>
<p>There are 4 properties of a service:</p>
<ol>
<li>It logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome</li>
<li>It is self contained.</li>
<li>Those who consume the service view it as a black box.</li>
<li>The service may be composed of other services.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="service-mesh">Service Mesh<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#service-mesh"></a></h3>
<p>A SOA architecture may employ a Service Mesh, which is a dedicated infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communication.</p>
<p>The service mesh uses a proxy</p>
<p>The service mesh can provide some benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide observability into communications (ie. system monitoring)</li>
<li>provide secure connections</li>
<li>automating retries</li>
</ul>
<p>A service mesh consists of network proxies paired with each service, along with a set of task management processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>proxies are known as the Data Plane.
<ul>
<li>Data plane intercepts calls between different services and processes them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>management processes known as Control Plane.
<ul>
<li>Control plane is the brain of the mesh that coordinates behaviour of proxies and provides APIs for operations personnel to manipulate and observe the entire network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
