<p>In actuality, RNGs implemented using computers are Pseudo Random Number Generators, since they are deterministic (ie. the output is known ahead of time)</p>
<ul>
<li>this sequence is completely determined by an initial value (the <strong>seed</strong>)
<ul>
<li>Given the same seed, the algorithm will produce the same sequence of numbers every time.</li>
<li>If the same random seed is deliberately shared, it becomes a secret key, so two or more systems using matching pseudorandom number algorithms and matching seeds can generate matching sequences of non-repeating numbers which can be used to synchronize remote systems, such as GPS satellites and receivers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine we created a simple PRNG algorithm that just took each decimal digit of Pi (3.14159...). So the first time, we got 1, then 4, and so on. In this example, we used a seed of <code>1</code>, meaning we start at the first decimal place. To introduce some element of randomness, we might then use a seed of <code>2</code> on a subsequent execution of the PRNG, giving us a sequence of <code>4, 1, 5, 9...</code></p>
