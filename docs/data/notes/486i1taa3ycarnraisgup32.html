<p>The simple way to handle authentication is by passing a basic authorization header:</p>
<pre><code>Authorization: Basic am9lc2htb2U6MTIzNDU=
</code></pre>
<p>Where the value is <code>username:password</code> <a href="/notes/YYt62mSW964cwb5nP0hva">base64</a> encoded.</p>
<p>This puts an unnecessary strain however on the database server, since it needs to compute the hash with each request.</p>
<p>One database per user is the general recommended approach for storage in CouchDB. Therefore, each user would store their own couchdb login credentials.</p>

<p>Security in a single CouchDB can only be set up to do either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can read/write everything (admin party)</li>
<li>Everyone can read, some can write</li>
<li>Some can read everything, and those same people can write everything</li>
</ul>
