<p>A bus carries byes of information back and forth between the hardware components of a computer system (or even between computers, if connected physically)</p>
<ul>
<li>Buses are normally designed to transfer fixed-sized chunks of bytes known as <em>words</em>. The number of bytes in a word (word size) is a fundamental system parameter that varies across different systems.
<ul>
<li>ex. word size could be 4 bytes long, while others could be 8. Typically smaller systems (such as embedded controllers) have word sizes of 1 or 2.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>An I/O device is the system's connection to the outside world</li>
<li>ex. keyboard and mouse for input, monitor for output, and disk drive for long-term data storage.</li>
<li>Each I/O device is connected to the I/O bus by either a controller or adapter.</li>
</ul>
