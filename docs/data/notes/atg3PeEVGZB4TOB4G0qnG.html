<h2 id="scripts"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#scripts"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Scripts</h2>
<ul>
<li>every script we define has <code>pre</code> and <code>post</code> version to it
<ul>
<li>ex. if we define a <code>install</code> script, then there is a <code>preinstall</code> that is implicitly defined</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="peer-dependencies"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#peer-dependencies"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Peer Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>peer dependencies are not automatically installed like dependencies and devDependencies are.
<ul>
<li>Instead, when we list a package as a peerDependency, we expect it to be provided from the host (the host would be our application)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>peer dependencies are most likely to be used only when creating npm packages.</li>
<li>ex. <code>react-dom</code> lists <code>react</code> as a peerDependency, since <code>react-dom</code> is useless unless we have <code>react</code> installed.
<ul>
<li>if <code>react-dom</code> had listed <code>react</code> as a dependency, then effectively we would have 2 different versions of react in our project.</li>
<li>by listing <code>react</code> as a peerDependency, <code>react-dom</code> is basically saying "hey npm, I don't have react as a dependency, but I do need react to work. If someone tries to install me, but they don't have react installed, spit a warning at them, cause I ain't gonna work properly"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>The scripts section of package.json has access to the commands provided by node_modules. for instance, we can make a script that calls <code>jest</code>. We can't do this in our shell because it doesn't have access to the package by default. we'd have to manually go into node_modules to do that. But the commands are loaded into the shell that is openeed when we run scripts in package.json</p>
