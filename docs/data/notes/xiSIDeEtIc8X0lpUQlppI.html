<p>Elasticsearch is an open-source, RESTful, distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene</p>
<ul>
<li>You can send data in the form of JSON documents to Elasticsearch using the API. Elasticsearch automatically stores the original document and adds a searchable reference to the document in the cluster’s index. You can then search and retrieve the document using the Elasticsearch API</li>
<li>ES is NoSQL and is more powerful, flexible, and faster than SQL's LIKE</li>
</ul>
<p>ES is typically used when you have :</p>
<ul>
<li>high data volumes, and are likely to need multiple nodes to process the data</li>
<li>unstructured or semi-structured data (log files, text, ...). You ingest the raw data in its original form.</li>
<li>the data is never updated. It’s ingested once, queried, and then purged according to some bulk retention policy (e.g. older than 30 days)</li>
<li>you need to access aggregate data more than individual records</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're searching for text. ES ranks search results based on how close the phrase or words are. SQL doesn't do this nearly as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>ES starts to shine when you start to do a lot of filtering</li>
</ul>
<p>Elastic search scales horizontally with your requirements.</p>
