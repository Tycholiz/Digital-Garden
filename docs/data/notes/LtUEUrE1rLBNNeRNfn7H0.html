<h1 id="amend">Amend<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#amend"></a></h1>
<p>Amend the most previous commit, allowing us to add/remove files to that commit, or even to simply change the commit message.</p>
<p>if we forgot to stage some changes as part of the last commit, simply add them to the working tree (should be clean, considering we just committed), then run <code>git commit --amend</code> </p>
