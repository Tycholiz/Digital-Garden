Functions that have side effects are often convenient and easy to write. Their effects can in principle be encoded in their names and in the comments. A function called `SetPassword` or `WriteFile` is obviously mutating some state and generating side effects, and we are used to dealing with that. It’s only when we start composing functions that have side effects on top of other functions that have side effects, and so on, that things start getting hairy. It’s not that side effects are inherently bad — it’s the fact that they are hidden from view that makes them impossible to manage at larger scales. Side effects don’t scale, and imperative programming is all about side effects.
