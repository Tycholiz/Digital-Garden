<p>Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data has been transferred through serial ports to devices such as modems, terminals, various peripherals, and directly between computers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern consumer PCs have largely replaced serial ports with higher-speed standards, primarily USB</li>
<li>serial ports are still frequently used in applications demanding simple, low-speed interfaces, such as industrial automation systems, scientific instruments, point of sale systems and some industrial and consumer products.</li>
<li>Server computers may use a serial port as a control console for diagnostics</li>
