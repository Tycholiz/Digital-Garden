<h1 id="cookies">Cookies<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cookies"></a></h1>
<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.</p>
<p>When a browser sends a request to a server, all of the cookies are automatically sent along with that request.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of using cookies versus local storage is that the server receives all of these cookies on initial request. If we are storing a JWT in local storage, then the user will be shown the non-authenticated version of the page initially. The reason is that local storage uses JavaScript, which only gets loaded after the HTML and CSS have been already received. This is a perceivable delay, over just storing the JWT in an http-only cookie.</p>
<p>If you use an HTTP only cookie for authentication, the user's data will be available on the server for the initial render</p>
<p>In the old days of the web, cookies werecause those cookies are susceptible to cross-site forgery attacks. Once the attacker has lured the unsuspecting victim to a hostile website, they can use JS scripts to exploit the cookies and tamper with the data to send malicious requests to the server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another vulnerability regards the chances of a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker can intercept the session ID and perform harmful requests to the server.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="httponly-cookie">httpOnly Cookie<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#httponly-cookie"></a></h3>
<p>a cookie that is only sent in the http requests to the server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, never accessible to the client-side javascript (making it immune to XSS attacks.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies and local storage can be accessed by anything client-side. This includes things like extensions. This makes storing sensitive information in a cookie a security risk. However, an HTTP-only cookie is different, in that its contents can only be set and read server side. This is why it is OK to store JWTs in an HTTP-only cookie.
The cookie is set via the response payload from the server</p>
<p>The clients only real job with an HTTP-only cookie is to store the cookie itself</p>
