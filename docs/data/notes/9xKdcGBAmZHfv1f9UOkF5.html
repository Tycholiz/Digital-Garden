<p>An adapter is a wrapper that converts the interface of an existing class into another interface that would be expected by a different client. It is a way of bridging the gap between incompatible interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.</li>
<li>ex. the <a href="/notes/nMCtMXVvjBsJk3iw1zoIO">Browser</a> uses an adapter to convert the interface of a <a href="/notes/OVODP7MLQgGI0WohlQEk3">DOM</a> of an XML document into a tree that can be displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anal: we have adapters for electrical sockets when visiting foreign countries. These bridge the gap between 2 interfaces that are incompatible with one another </p>
<p>An adapter may also be known as a <em>wrapper</em>, though that name may also refer to a <a href="/notes/UxzKopcw8JCSnPc8HKbjX">decorator</a>.</p>
<p>An adapter allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It does this by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces may be incompatible, but the inner functionality should suit the need. </li>
</ul>
<p>The adapter design pattern solves problems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can a class be reused that does not have an interface that a client requires?</li>
<li>How can classes that have incompatible interfaces work together?</li>
<li>How can an alternative interface be provided for a class?</li>
</ul>
<p>Often an (already existing) class can't be reused only because its interface doesn't conform to the interface clients require. The adapter design pattern describes how to solve such problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a separate adapter class that converts the (incompatible) interface of a class (adaptee) into another interface (target) clients require.</li>
<li>Work through an adapter to work with (reuse) classes that do not have the required interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key idea in this pattern is to work through a separate adapter that adapts the interface of an (already existing) class without changing it.</p>
