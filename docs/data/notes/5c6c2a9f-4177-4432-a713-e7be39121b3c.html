<ul>
<li>each database cluster has a set of database users, which are distinct from the users that the OS of the server manages.</li>
<li>database users are global across a cluster installation.</li>
<li>users own database objects, such as tables. These owners can assign priveleges on those objects to other users.</li>
<li>freshly initialized postgres systems will always contain a predefined user with ID 1, which has the same name as the OS user that initialized the db cluster. However, it is often a best practice to name this user <code>postgres</code> instead.
<ul>
<li>this is a superuser</li>
<li>To create more users, we need to connect as this user first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
