<p>Peering involves two IPSs coming together to exchange traffic with each other freely, and for mutual benefit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, ISPs of competing size have peer-agreements in place, ensuring that all traffic is forwarded freely, since each ISP will make money from their customers anyway</li>
</ul>

<p>Contrasted with Peering, this is when a bigger ISP charges a smaller ISP for the right to use its network in order to have access to the larger internet</p>
<hr>
<p>An ISP is not necessarily a telecommunications company. In fact, it can be a university, or a private company providing internet access directly to its employees.</p>
