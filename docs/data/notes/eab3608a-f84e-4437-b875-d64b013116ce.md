# Workspace
A collection of one or more folders that are opened in a VS Code window (instance)
- Think of a workspace as the root of a project that has extra VS Code knowledge and capabilities.

The concept of a workspace enables VS Code to:
- Configure settings that only apply to a specific folder or folders but not others.
- Persist task and debugger launch configurations that are only valid in the context of that workspace.
- Store and restore UI state associated with that workspace (for example, the files that are opened).
- Selectively enable or disable extensions only for that workspace.

## Multi-root workspaces
allow us to pick and include other folder trees to exist within the current workspace, allowing us the benefits that having all files under a workspace gives us.
