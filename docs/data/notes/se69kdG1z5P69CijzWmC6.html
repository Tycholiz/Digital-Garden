<p>A generator can be used to control the iteration behaviour of a loop
A generator is also an iterator, meaning it can be looped over</p>
<p>A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array. A generator: </p>
<ul>
<li>has parameters </li>
<li>can be called </li>
<li>generates a sequence of values</li>
</ul>
<p>However, instead of building an array and returning all values at once, a generator yields the values one at a time, requiring less memory, and has the added benefit of allowing the caller to access the first few values immediately, instead of having to wait for the whole array to return.</p>
<ul>
<li>In short, a generator looks like a function but behaves like an iterator.</li>
</ul>
