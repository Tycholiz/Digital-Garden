<p>Key–value databases work in a very different fashion from the better known relational databases (RDB)</p>
<ul>
<li>RDBs predefine the data structure in the database as a series of tables containing fields with well defined data types. Exposing the data types to the database program allows it to apply a number of optimizations.</li>
<li>In contrast, key–value systems treat the data as a single opaque collection, with no unified structure to the value of each record.
<ul>
<li>this more closely follow the principles of <a href="/notes/12a2891c-e26b-47db-9e2e-7a3de90b672b">OOP</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>key–value databases often use far less memory than RDBs to store the same data</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because optional values are not represented by placeholders or input parameters, as they are in most RDBs</li>
</ul>
