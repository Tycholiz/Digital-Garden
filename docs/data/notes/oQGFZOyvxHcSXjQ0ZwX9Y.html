<p>A resistor controls the electric current as it passes through them. </p>
<ul>
<li>The colour-coded lines are used to determine their value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resistors have many uses including: </p>
<ol>
<li>reduce current flow</li>
<li>adjust signal levels</li>
<li>divide voltages. This happens when resistors are lined up in series with each other. </li>
</ol>
<p>Resistors dissipate electrical power as heat</p>
<ul>
<li>For bigger applications like a motor, this is exactly what they are used for.
