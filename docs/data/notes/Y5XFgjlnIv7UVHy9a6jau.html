<h1 id="jump-list">Jump List<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#jump-list"></a></h1>
<p>Vim remembers the locations you have recently visited (where you jumped from). Each position (file name, column number, line number) is recorded in a jump list, and each window has a separate jump list that records the last 100 positions where a jump occurred.</p>
<ul>
<li>The commands that are regarded as "jumps" include searching, substitute and marks. Scrolling through a file is not regarded as jumping.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like a web browser, you can go back, then forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Ctrl-O to jump back to the previous (older) location.</li>
<li>Press Ctrl-I (same as Tab) to jump forward to the next (newer) location.</li>
</ul>
<p>use <code>:jump</code> to see the jumplist</p>
