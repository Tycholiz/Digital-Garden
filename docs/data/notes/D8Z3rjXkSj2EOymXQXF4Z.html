<ul>
<li>Pull and Push are two different protocols that describe how a data Producer can communicate with a data Consumer.

</ul>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>A regular function is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns a single value on invocation.</li>
<li>A generator function is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns zero to (potentially) infinite values on iteration.</li>
<li>A Promise is a computation that may (or may not) eventually return a single value.</li>
<li>An Observable is a lazily evaluated computation that can synchronously or asynchronously return zero to (potentially) infinite values from the time it's invoked onwards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pull</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer determines when it receives data from the data Producer</li>
<li>The Producer itself is unaware of when the data will be delivered to the Consumer.</li>
<li>ex. every javascript function is a pull system
<ul>
<li>The function itself is the producer, and the calling code is the consumer. The reason the calling code is called the consumer is because the calling code "pulls" out a <em>single</em> return value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Push</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Producer determines when to send data to the consumer, and the consumer is unaware of when it will receive that data.</li>
<li>ex. Promises and Observables are a push system, since the promise (a producer) delivers a resolved value to the registered callbacks (the consumers).
<ul>
<li>it is the Promise which is in charge of determining precisely when that value is "pushed" to the callbacks.</li>
<li>ex. An Observable is a Producer of multiple values, "pushing" them to Observers (Consumers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
