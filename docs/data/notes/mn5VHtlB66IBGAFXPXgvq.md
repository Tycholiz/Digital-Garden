## HTTP Requests
### GET vs. POST
- there are some limitations to GET requests as follows:
    - GET requests can be cached
    - GET requests remain in the browser history
    - GET requests can be bookmarked
    - GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
    - GET requests have length restrictions
    - GET requests should be used only to retrieve data
- Some + points on POST requests:
    - POST requests are never cached
    - POST requests do not remain in the browser history
    - POST requests cannot be bookmarked
    - POST requests have no restrictions on data length
