<p>The default output of <code>git diff</code> is a valid patch file, meaning we can pipe its output into a file, give that file to someone else, and they can apply it with the <code>patch</code> command.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. <code>git diff master..experiment > experiment.patch</code>. The recipient can then run <code>patch -p1 &#x3C; ~/experiment.patch</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Each patch represents a full commit, complete with metadata like author and date.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. If we have made 2 commits since master, then running <code>git format-patch master</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="range-diff">range-diff<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#range-diff"></a></h3>
<p><code>git range-diff</code> allows us to inspect how two commit ranges are different</p>
<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#under-the-hood"></a></h2>
<p>to compare 2 commits, Git starts by looking at the root trees of each commit (which are almost always different). Then, Git initiates a depth-first-search on the subtrees by following pairs when paths for the current tree have different OIDs.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git diff</code> - show changes between index and working tree</li>
<li><code>git diff --staged</code> - show changes between index and HEAD (ie. last commit)</li>
<li><code>git diff master..feature-branch</code> - show changes between master and feature-branch 
<ul>
<li><code>git diff f733ed..</code> - show changes between a commit and HEAD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>git diff -- package.json</code> - show only changes in a specific file.</li>
</ul>
