When you write a class, youâ€™re describing how the JVM should make an object of that type.

### Array
- quite primitive compared to those found in other languages (like Javascript)
- fixed size once created
- memory location for the array is contiguous
- can create an array with specific size with `int array[] = new int[size];` 
- no `indexOf()` method

### ArrayList
- dynamic in size
- capable of storing different types in the same list
- requires more memory to store the elements as well as more time to iterate

usage:
```java
ArrayList myList = new ArrayList();
myList.get()
myList.Add ("Delhi");
```
- create with ``
- elements accessed with ``
- elements added with ``
