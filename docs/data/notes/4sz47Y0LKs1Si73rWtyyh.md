Use saturated colors (pure hues) when attracting attention is the priority, and desaturated colors when performance and efficiency are the priority.

Generally, desaturated, bright colors are perceived as friendly and professional; desaturated, dark colors are perceived as serious and professional; and saturated colors are perceived as more exciting and dynamic.
