### Syntax for joining on a key
Most common is to use JOIN ... ON
```sql
...
inner join T1 on T2.id = T1.id
```

We can also use the USING clause, which is a shorthand that allows you to take advantage of the specific situation where both sides of the join use the same name for the joining column(s)
- For example, the following produces the join condition ON T1.a = T2.a AND T1.b = T2.b.
```sql
select * from T1
inner join T2 using (a, b)
```
Doing it like this also suppresses redundant columns
- there is no need to print both of the matched columns, since they must have equal values

### Anti-join
An anti-join is meant to keep only the rows that fail a test.
- ex. imagine we have a result set of students having taken an Economics exam. If we want to filter to include only those students who did not finish the exam (denoted by `null` value in the `score` column), we can filter out those who did in fact finish the exam.
    - note: since WHERE clause is just a filter, it doesn't care which columns are actually returned by the query. This is why we can just say `SELECT 1`. Postgres doesn't even look at what was selected; only that something was returned from the query.
```sql
select *
    from students
    inner join results on students.id = results.student_id
where not exists (
    select 1
        from results r
    where score is not null
)
```
