<p>Docker engine is a tool that lets us install Docker Engine on virtual hosts and manage those hosts</p>
<pre><code>- Therefore, it is something we install on our own computer.
- with the **driver** concept, we can deploy to 3rd party cloud services, like AWS, DigitalOcean, or even VirtualBox on your local machine
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><em>docker-machine</em> commands let us start, inspect, stop, and restart hosts, as well as configure a docker client to talk to the hosts.</li>
<li>it allows us to control the docker engine of a VM created using docker-machine</li>
<li>The main reason you would use docker-machine is when you want to create a deployment environment for your application and manage all the micro-services running on it</li>
<li>To setup, all we need to do is point our <code>docker-machine</code> CLI at our managed host, which enables us to run docker commands directly on that host.</li>
</ul>

<p>The connection to a docker machine is made available through env variables. By default, they are unset, giving us our default connection
<code>docker-machine env -u</code> will show us how to unset all variables to return to our default connection
If we wanted to connect to minikube, we could run `eval $(minikube docker-env)</p>
