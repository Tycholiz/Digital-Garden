### Backlinks

Link to a note
- `[[code.git.cli]]` will link to a note of the same hierarchy
- we can generate a new note by entering a new hierarchy within the braces and hitting `F12`
- we can alias a backlink like this `[[git cli|code.git.cli]]`
- all backlinks of current note can be seen on sidebar

Embed a note/section of note in another note
- You can create a note reference by using CMD+SHIFT+R while inside a note, then paste that reference into another note. This creates an embedded note in the current note.
	- Instead of embedding a whole note, we can embed just what's within a header, by highlighting the head before using CMD+SHIFT+R
		- If we want to retain our original header, remove the `,1` in the reference

Link to particular section of a note
- You can use `CMD+SHIFT+C`
	- can do it for the whole note, or just a highlighted section
