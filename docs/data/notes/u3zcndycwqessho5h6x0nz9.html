<p>A coin is a chain of transaction records, where each record represents each time an owner transferred the coin to a new owner as payment. </p>
<ul>
<li>The latest transaction record in the chain shows the coin's current owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each coin owner has a <a href="/notes/bO8xztJCzUxsN2sM4YsBE">public/private key</a> pair which the network uses to verify the integrity of transactions.</p>
<p>When the current owner of a coin wants to transfer the coin to a new owner, they create a transaction record which contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>The public key of the coin's new owner.</li>
<li>A hash of the previous transaction record in the chain.</li>
<li>A signature of the above hash signed with the current owner's private key.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information allows the new owner to verify that it received the coin from the right owner.</p>

<p>Each block of the <a href="/notes/DVpVUmavSoVDA7UIlPzLX">blockchain</a> is identified with a <a href="/notes/u0xXQ2GmDkPpk20TB9Y0N">hash</a> and contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hash of the previous block in the chain.</li>
<li>A set of transactions.</li>
<li>A nonce</li>
</ul>
<p>When you make a payment, the payee won't accept it until the transaction is in the blockchain. </p>
<ul>
<li>since all transactions are in the blockchain, the payee will find out if the coin has been spent before.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a peer receives new transactions, it collects them into a block. Before it can add the block to the blockchain, it needs to do actual CPU work (called <em>proof-of-work</em>).</p>
<p>The process of finding the <em>nonce</em> is calling <em>mining</em></p>
<p>It takes 10 minutes on average for a peer to mine a new block, which means that the parties involved in a transaction have to wait for about 10 minutes before it appears on the blockchain.</p>
<ul>
<li>A peer broadcasts a block to all peers after finding its proof of work. </li>
</ul>
