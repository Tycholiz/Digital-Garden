<p>An opaque type is a type that "wraps" lower-level types, and is often used when either the underlying implementation is complex, or the user simply does not need to know about the inner workings</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. there is a type in Swift called <code>CFString</code>. It is an opaque type that provides a series of methods that allow for string manipulation and string conversion. For example, we have a <code>.length</code> and <code>.indexOf</code> methods. The implementation details of these methods is unimportant to the user of this type, so they have been hidden. 
<ul>
<li>This is the essence of an opaque type, in that a native type has had some extra functionality added to it by being "wrapped".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An "opaque type" is a type where you don't have a full definition for the struct (or class in the case of C++)</p>
<ul>
<li>In C, you can tell the compiler that a type will be defined later by using a forward declaration:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="language-c"><code class="language-c"><span class="token comment">// forward declaration of struct in C and C++ </span>
<span class="token keyword">struct</span> <span class="token class-name">Foo</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>here, the compiler only has enough info to be able to declare pointers to <code>Foo</code>, which is sometimes all we need to do</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows library and framework creators to hide implementation details, allowing the users of that library to call helper functions to create, change or destroy instances of a forward declared <code>struct</code> (also <code>class</code> in C++) </li>
</ul>
