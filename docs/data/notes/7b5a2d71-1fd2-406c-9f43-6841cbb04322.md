### Statements
- all statements in C end in semicolon `;`
- braces `{`/`}` can be used to group declarations and statements together into a *compound statement* (or block)
	- this makes them syntactically equivalent to a single statement
- the fact that `;` denotes the end of a statement rings true for *for loops* too. The first and third are assignments (or fn calls), while the second is a relational expression.
	- All are optional, so `for (;;)` is an infinite loop
