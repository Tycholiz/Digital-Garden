<p>A rules engine can be visualized as a set of if-then-else statements to implement some business logic of our application.</p>
<p>Example: determining car insurance premiums</p>
<pre><code>if car.owner.hasCellPhone then premium += 100;
if car.model.theftRating > 4 then premium += 200;
if car.owner.livesInDodgyArea &#x26;&#x26; car.model.theftRating > 2 then premium += 300;
</code></pre>
<p>A rules engine is a tool that makes it easier to program using this computational model</p>
<p>An important property of rule engines is chaining - where the action part of one rule changes the state of the system in such a way that it alters the value of the condition part of other rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaining sounds appealing, since it supports more complex behaviors, but can easily end up being very hard to reason about and debug.
<ul>
<li>Often, it is easy to set up a rules system, but very hard to maintain it because nobody can understand this implicit program flow; a consequence of leaving the imperative computational model</li>
</ul>
