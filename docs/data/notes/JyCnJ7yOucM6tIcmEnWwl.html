<p>Diodes only allow current to flow in a single direction</p>
<ul>
<li>This is done by having zero resistance in one direction, and very high resistance in the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Diodes have 2 terminals, each of which is an electrode: an <em>anode</em> and a <em>cathode</em></p>
<ul>
<li>anodes allow current to flow in from outside a circuit</li>
<li>cathodes allow current to flow out of a polarized device.
