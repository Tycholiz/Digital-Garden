<ul>
<li>IP is unreliable, in that we can't guarantee that the data that's sent is received without being corrupted. IP cannot even guarantee that the data arrives. TCP is reliable. Interestingly, TCP is built on top of IP. The question is, how is a reliable technology built on top of an unreliable one? The answer is that TCP acts as sort of the manager of a transaction of data from one place to another. If data arrives corrupted, it will repeat the request until data comes in fully-formed
<ul>
<li>Since the end-user never knows about the data-loss that might have occurred somewhere along the way, TCP is effectively an abstraction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TCP is said to exist between the <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/5T9TTS59VHnhqvlEeGgP2">sockets</a> of two processes</p>
<p>On the TCP level, the tuple (source ip, source port, destination ip, destination port) must be unique for each simultaneous connection. That means a single client cannot open more than 65535 simultaneous connections to a single server. But a server can (theoretically) serve 65535 simultaneous connections per client.</p>
<ul>
<li>So in practice the server is only limited by how much CPU power, memory etc. it has to serve requests, not by the number of TCP connections to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>The connection between 2 processes via TCP is full-duplex, meaning the two processes can send messages to each other simultaneously.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the application finishes sending a message, it must tear down the connection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TCP transports application-layer messages such as HTTP requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Works by establishing a connection between 2 hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data is guaranteed to be delivered, and in the order it was sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TCP breaks long messages in to shorter segments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
