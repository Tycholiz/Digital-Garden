<p><code>toThrow</code> executes a function passed in expect, and verifies that it throws an error.</p>
<p>In this case, you're not passing expect a function. You're executing a function that throws an error. toThrow is never executed, and even if it were, it would throw an error, telling you that it should receive a function, but received something else instead.</p>
<p><code>expect(someFunctionThatThrows())</code> is essentially the same as <code>expect(throw new Error())</code>.</p>
