<h1 id="pod"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#pod"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Pod</h1>
<p>A Pod is a way to represent a running process in a cluster.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pod refers to a pod of whales or pea pod</li>
</ul>
<p>A pod is a collection of containers that share resources</p>
<ul>
<li>Though realistically, we tend to only have a single container in a Pod. We might see more than 1, but it normally isn't more than 2 or 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>A pod is designed to run multiple cooperative processes that could be seen as a single cohesive piece of work. This is the level of abstraction that we live at in Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Pods are the building blocks of Kubernetes, just as containers are the building block of Docker.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Docker, we think in terms of processes. In Kubernetes, we think in terms of multiple processes (co-existing to perform one task)</li>
</ul>
<p>All the containers in a pod run on the same machine.</p>
<ul>
<li>That is, a pod cannot be split across multiple nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>A pod provides a way to set <code>.env</code> variables, mount storage, and feed other information into a container</p>
<p>A pod encapsulates one or more containers deployed together on one host, thereby sharing the same resources (of the host)</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. if we have 5 containers of a mongodb service deployed, and 3 of them were on the same host (ex. same machine), those 3 together would be called a Pod</li>
</ul>
<p>Pods are not long-lived services. Even though Kubernetes is doing its best to ensure that the containers in a Pod are (almost) always up-and-running, the same cannot be said for Pods. In Kubernetes, containers are fault-tolerant, but pods are not.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a Pod fails, gets destroyed, or gets evicted from a Node, it will not be rescheduled.</li>
<li>Similarly, if a whole node is destroyed, all the Pods on it will cease to exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each pod gets its own IP address, though it is unreliable, since pods are designed to be short-lived; so the creation of a new pod would result in a new IP</p>
<p>When the container inside a pod exits, the pod dies too.</p>
<p>When a container inside a pod fails, Kubernetes will create a new container based off the same image:</p>
<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">$ kubectl exec -it db pkill mongod
$ kubectl get pods
</code></pre>
<p>produces (note how RESTARTS is 1):</p>
<pre><code>NAME READY STATUS  RESTARTS AGE
db   1/1   Running 1        13m
</code></pre>
<p>Everything in a pod is tightly coupled.</p>
<p>The containers in a pod are not necessarily Docker containers, though it is the most common implementation.</p>
<p>Normally pods are not created by hand. Instead, we depend on higher level constructs like Controllers to do that for us.</p>
<p>Pods...</p>
<ul>
<li>are mortal. They are born and cannot be resurrected once they die.</li>
<li>are not intended to run multiple instances of the same application,</li>
</ul>
<p>Containers within a pod...</p>
<ul>
<li>share an IP address and port space, and can find each other via localhost.</li>
<li>share storage space</li>
</ul>
<p>In a pre-container world, being executed on the same physical or virtual machine would mean being executed on the same logical host.</p>
<ul>
<li>logical host would contain relatively tightly coupled code</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though a Pod can contain any number of containers, the most common use case is to use the <strong>single-container-in-a-Pod</strong> model</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine we had your express api server image and a postgres image. If we put both of these in a single pod, we would no longer be able to have different numbers of containers. For instance, we could not have 2 api containers and 1 postgres container.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are scenarios when having multiple containers in a Pod is a good idea. However, they are very specific and, in most cases, are based on one container that acts as the main service and the rest serving as side-cars.</p>
<p>A frequent use case is multi-container Pods used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous integration (CI)</li>
<li>Continious Delivery (CD)</li>
<li>Continuous Deployment processes (CDP)</li>
</ul>

<p>When we create a pod, a hash of the PodTemplate is taken and it appended to the Pod name. This means that 2 pods created from identical PodTemplates on different machines will produce the same hash.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is also how Git SHAs work.</li>
</ul>
<p>spec: PodTemplate is in the ReplicaSet</p>

<p>There are 3 major components: API Server, Scheduler, Kubelet</p>
<h4 id="api-server"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#api-server"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>API Server</h4>
<p>Central component of the K8s cluster</p>
<ul>
<li>runs on the master node
<ul>
<li>with Minikube, both master and worker nodes are baked into the same VM. Realistically, the K8s cluster should have the two separated on different hosts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the coordination in Kubernetes consists of a component writing to the API Server resource that another component is watching. The second component will then react to changes almost immediately.</p>
<h4 id="scheduler"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#scheduler"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Scheduler</h4>
<p>The scheduler is also running on the master node.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its job is to watch for unassigned pods and assign them to a node which has available resources (CPU and memory) matching Pod requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="kubelet"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#kubelet"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Kubelet</h4>

<h3 id="process-of-creating-a-pod"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#process-of-creating-a-pod"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Process of creating a pod</h3>
<p>ie. when running <code>kubectl create -f pod/db.yml</code></p>
<ol>
<li>kubectl (the K8s client) sends a request to the API Server, requesting the creation of a pod</li>
<li>Since the scheduler is watching the API server for new events, it detected that there is an unassigned Pod.</li>
<li>The scheduler decided which node to assign the Pod to and sent that information to the API server.</li>
<li>Kubelet is also watching the API server. It detected that the Pod was assigned to the node it is running on.</li>
<li>Kubelet sent a request to Docker requesting the creation of the containers that form the Pod. In our case, the Pod defines a single container based on the mongo image.</li>
<li>Finally, Kubelet sent a request to the API server notifying it that the Pod was created successfully.</li>
</ol>
