## What is it?
Replication means keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines that are connected via a network.

Each node that stores a copy of the database is called a replica. 

If you look at two database nodes at the same moment in time, youâ€™re likely to see different data on the two nodes, because write requests arrive on different nodes at different times (replication lag).
- These inconsistencies occur no matter what [[replication strategy|db.distributed.replication.strategies]] the database uses (single-leader, multi-leader, or leaderless replication).
- Most replicated databases provide at least eventual consistency
	- in other words, this means that the inconsistency among replicas is temporary and eventually resolves itself.

## Why do we do it?
- Latency: To keep data geographically close to your users (and thus reduce latency)
- Availabrlity: to allow the system to continue working even if some nodes have failed
- Scalability: to [[scale out|deploy.scaling#horizontal-scaling-aka-scaling-out]] the number of machines that can serve read queries (and thus increase read throughput)
- Network fault-tolerance: to keep the application working when there is a network interruption

In a world where our data didn't change over time, replication would be simple: we would just copy the data to each node and be done.
- what makes replication hard is figuring out how to handle changes to replicated data.

Normally, replication is quite fast: most database systems apply changes to followers in less than a second.
- However, there are circumstances when followers might fall behind the leader by several minutes or more; for example:
	- if a follower is recovering from a failure
	- if the system is operating near maximum capacity
	- if there are network problems between the nodes

There are tradeoffs to consider when implementing replication (both are often configuration options in databases):
- synchronous or asynchronous replication
- how to handle failed replicas
