<h1 id="workspace">Workspace<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#workspace"></a></h1>
<p>A collection of one or more folders that are opened in a VS Code window (instance)</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of a workspace as the root of a project that has extra VS Code knowledge and capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of a workspace enables VS Code to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure settings that only apply to a specific folder or folders but not others.</li>
<li>Persist task and debugger launch configurations that are only valid in the context of that workspace.</li>
<li>Store and restore UI state associated with that workspace (for example, the files that are opened).</li>
<li>Selectively enable or disable extensions only for that workspace.</li>
</ul>

<p>allow us to pick and include other folder trees to exist within the current workspace, allowing us the benefits that having all files under a workspace gives us.</p>
