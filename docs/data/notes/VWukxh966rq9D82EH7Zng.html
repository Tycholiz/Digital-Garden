<p>When a new user connects to the database, postgres will fork a new process.</p>
<ul>
<li>After this point the client and the new process communicate directly, without intervention from the original process.</li>
<li>This shows the dependency on processes rather than threads, giving us more stability at the cost of higher connection start-up costs.</li>
<li>each connection into Postgres is going to consume about 10 MB of memory from your database</li>
<li>These start-up costs can be overcome with pooling</li>
</ul>
<p>In postgres, each client connecting to the database has its own process </p>
<ul>
<li>connection can be verified by running <code>select true as "Connection test";</code></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Connection String</em> - the database url used to connect to the database (<code>postgres:///...</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>if we specify the connection string as <code>postgres:///mydb</code>, then we are implicitly passing our computer's username and no password, which would be equivalent to <code>postgres:///kyletycholiz@localhost:5432/mydb</code> 
<ul>
<li>spec: are these default variables determined by env variables like PGHOST?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
