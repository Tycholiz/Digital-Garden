<ul>
<li>The JWK is a JSON object that contains a well-known public key which can be be used to validate the signature of a signed JWT</li>
<li>If the issuer of your JWT used an asymmetric key to sign the JWT, it will likely host a file called a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). The JWKS is a JSON object that contains the property keys, which in turn holds an array of JWK objects.</li>
<li>The service may only use one JWK for validating web tokens, however the JWKS may contain multiple keys if the service rotates signing certificates.
<ul>
<li>we can use a service like Auth0 or Okta to store our JWKs, which will be located at an endpoint hosted at their domain. </li>
<li>Any time your application validates a JWT, it will attempt to retrieve the JWK(S) from the issuer in order to ensure the JWT signature matches the content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Login</p>
<ol>
<li>user enters email/pw combination</li>
<li>email/pw sent to server. The server takes in that password, appends the salt to it, then hashes it and compares it to the hashed pw stored in the database.</li>
<li>if the passwords match, then the server will send back a signed JWT 
<ul>
<li>the jwt is composed of 3 parts:
<ul>
<li>header - usually contains type of token and signing algo used:
<pre><code>{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>claims (aka payload)
<ul>
<li>this is the data that we can encode into the token</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>signature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>HTTP requests</p>
<ol>
<li>server receives the request, along with the JWT.</li>
<li>JWT header and claims are combined with the secret (stored on the server) to generate a "test signature", to compare against the original signature (also received in the JWT) </li>
</ol>
