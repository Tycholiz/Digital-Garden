The main way to query data from CouchDB is through the REST API.

### URI
The URI to query to get a viewâ€™s result is `/<database>/_design/<designdocname>/_view/viewname`

### Query Params
we can add query params to narrrow the result, which is how we'd achieve similar things to using the [[WHERE|pg.clause.where]] clause in SQL:
- `?key="2009/01/30 18:04:11"`
- `?startkey="2010/01/01 00:00:00"&endkey="2010/02/00 00:00:00"` (inclusive range)

We can sort the results by multiple fields by using an array as a key, since results are always sorted by key.
- `?startkey=["myslug"]&endkey=["myslug", 2]`

We can sort by descending order
- `?descending=true`

We can include the full body of each document in the results
- `?include_docs=true`
