<ul>
<li>In a simple cryptographic system, I have some message that I can encrypt using a key. I can then give you that key along with the information, and you can decrypt it and read the message.
<ul>
<li>This is known as Symmetric Encryption</li>
<li>The problem with this, is that I need to send you the key. Since we have not yet established a secure connection, we cannot be sure that no one is listening in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in Public Key Cryptography, we generate a key pair: a private key and public key.
<ul>
<li>This is known as Asymmetric Encryption</li>
<li>It is Asymmetric because key A is used to encrypt the message, while key B is used to decrypt it.
<ul>
<li>Anything we encrypt with key A can only be decrypted with key B, and anything encrypted with key B can only be decrypted with key A</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now we can have a situation where both you and I have our own key-pairs, with each person's public key being widely distributable. 
<ul>
<li>Now if I want to send something to you, I just need your public key. I can encrypt the message like this, and you are the only person that can decrypt it, since you have the private key. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This system also allows the receiver of a message know exactly who sent it. Consider that if I use my private key to encrypt a message and send it out, anyone with my public key can decrypt it. This has an important implication, which is that if you were able to successfully decrypt my message, then you know for a fact that I was the one who encrypted it. </li>
<li>In the public key system, the public key is for encrypting, while the private key is for decrypting.</li>

<p>Imagine we wanted to play a game over poker over the mail. Of course, each player needs to be assured that the same rules apply as if the game was in person (neither side knows the other's cards, each side only takes 5 cards, etc). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player 1 puts each card in an envelope, and attaches a lock. This lock is only openable by player 1, but only one key is needed to open all the locks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player 1 mails all 52 cards to Player 2. Player 2 then puts his own lock on all envelopes. Again, his key will open all envelopes. Then Player 2 will send the double-locked envelopes back to Player 1. (the randomized nature of the mail process acts as a secure and trusted method of shuffling) </p>
<ul>
<li>note: we have created a situation where neither player can reveal any card on their own. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player 1 now has 52 double-locked envelopes, so now must choose 5 cards for Player 2. Once they are chosen, Player 1 takes his lock off those cards and mails just those 5 cards. Once Player 2 receives those cards, he can unlock them and now knows his hand. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player 1 now has 47 double-locked envelopes, so now he must choose 5 for himself. Once he chooses, he sends them to Player 2. Player 2 removes his lock from those 5 cards, and sends them back to Player 1. Player 1 removes his lock, and now knows his own hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This system of double-locking creates what is called <em>commutativity</em>. A commutative crypographic algorithm is one that is order-independent (ie. it doesn't matter which order the locks are taken off)  </p>

<ul>
<li>If this game of poker were to take place over the internet, each of the 52 cards would have a numeric value (1-52). We need a way to "lock" each card. Player 1 creates his key (<code>k</code>) by choosing a random number. He then takes that number and raises each card to that value.
<ul>
<li>ex. if <code>k = 3</code>, then each card value is raised to the 3rd power. This is equivalent of locking the envelopes, as long as Player 2 doesn't know what <code>k</code> is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Player 2 then can create his own key (<code>j</code>), and raise each (already encrypted) card value to that value. Now we have double-locked cards.
<ul>
<li>It's important to note that <code>(2^5)^3</code> is mathematiacally equivalent to <code>(2^3)^5</code>. In other words, the locks can be applied or removed in any order. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, to remove the locks, each player simply needs to multiple the exponent by the inverse of their key (if Player 1 wants to remove the locks of 5 cards, then he just needs to multiply the exponent by <code>-3</code>)</li>
</ul>
