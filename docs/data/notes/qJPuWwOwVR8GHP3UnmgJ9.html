<h1 id="int">Int<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#int"></a></h1>
<p>Typically, a <code>short int</code> is 16 bits (2 bytes), and <code>long int</code> 32 bits (4 bytes)</p>
<ul>
<li>therefore, an int is a 32-bit data type
<ul>
<li>this depends on the natural size of integers on the host machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in reality, 31 bits are available for the number, since 1 has to be reserved for the sign (+/-)</li>
<li>Whenever a number is being assigned to an ‘int’ type variable, it is first converted to its binary representation then it is kept in memory at specific location.</li>
</ul>
