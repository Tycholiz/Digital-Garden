<h3 id="rigidbody">RigidBody<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#rigidbody"></a></h3>
<p><code>RigidBody</code> gives a GameObject physical properties so that it can interact with gravity, air density, and other GameObjects.
RigidBody can be used to determine if an object should be frozen in 2D/3D space or not</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#materials"></a></h3>
<p><code>Materials</code> are components that define the surface characteristics of objects and how those surfaces interact with light. In each new 3D Scene, directional light is included to simulate the sun.</p>
<p>You can drag a PNG into the assets folder of a Unity project, and by doing so, it will become a material (subfolder of <code>assets/</code>) that can be dragged onto an object of the scene</p>
<h4 id="physic-materials">Physic Materials<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#physic-materials"></a></h4>
<p>With Physic Materials, you can make an object bounce and change its friction and drag properties.These properties take effect when the object is under the effects of gravity.</p>

<li>in project window, right-click for dropdown and <code>create > physic material</code></li>

<h3 id="colliders">Colliders<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#colliders"></a></h3>
<p>The sense of collision, in that you cannot pass through it.
A collider has a material property, giving us the ability to drag one of our materials on top to give characteristics to the collision of an object</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. if we have a physic material that gives the quality of bounciness, then we can apply that to the collider, which makes the underlying GameObject bouncy. </li>
</ul>
<p>Objects like spheres and cubes by default have collision</p>
<p>Colliders require a RigidBody to detect collision in our physics</p>
