<p>Identity federation is a system of trust between two parties for the purpose of authenticating users.</p>
<ul>
<li>the SP trusts the IdP to authenticate users and relies on the information provided by the IdP about them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Federated identities are users that can access secure AWS account resources with external identities. </p>
<ul>
<li>External identities can come from a corporate identity store (such as LDAP or Windows Active Directory) or from a third party (such as Login in with Amazon, Facebook, or Google). </li>
<li>Federated identities do not sign in with the AWS Management Console or AWS access portal. The type of external identity in use determines how federated identities sign in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Identity Federation is a way that we can manage <a href="/notes/yBNgydTx5k1BfiGgW3BbD">federated identity</a> in AWS.</p>
<p>The problem Identity Federation solves is, "how do we grapple with the fact that we have multitudes of different employees, contractors</p>
<ul>
<li>an identity provider (IdP) is responsible for user authentication.</li>
<li>a service provider (SP) controls access to resources.
<ul>
<li>an SP might be a service or application</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After authenticating a user, the IdP sends the SP a message, called an assertion, containing the user's sign-in name and other attributes that the SP needs to establish a session with the user and to determine the scope of resource access that the SP should grant.</p>
<p>Federation is a common approach to building access control systems which manage users centrally within a central IdP and govern their access to multiple applications and services acting as SPs.</p>
<p>AWS SSO and <a href="/notes/hUvXun5sLRxKOZXIZFuV1">AWS</a> are two tools from AWS that allow us to <a href="/notes/aep8dn2mjw5lnwggy0cmo7x">federate</a> our workforce into AWS accounts and business applications.</p>
