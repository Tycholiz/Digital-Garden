since a process is a type of environment, environment variables can be associated with a process.
- ex. when we say `process.env` we are talking about getting environment variables that exist during a specific process

If a program is a set of instructions to carry out a specific task, then a process is just **a program in execution**

a **Signal** is the way that a process can communicate with the OS
- Signal and interrupt are basically same, but with a small distinction:
    - interrupts are generated by the processor and handled by the kernel
    - signals are generated by the kernel and handled by the process.

Every time a program wants to do something (like process a key press, or open a file, or exit) that program needs to ask its parent to do it for it (the parent is the kernel)


# Debugging
- strace/truss, ltrace and gdb are generally good ideas for looking at why a process is stuck. (truss -u on Solaris is particularly helpful; I find ltrace too often presents arguments to library calls in an unusable format.) Solaris also has useful /proc-based tools, some of which have been ported to Linux. (pstack is often helpful).
