<p>Git submodules solve the problem: "what if we need to use another project from within our project repo?"</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. we have a module (e.g. a React UI library) that we want to use in multiple projects</li>
</ul>
<p>One reason that we'd include a submodule package instead of just including it as an npm package it is that in the latter case, we need to run <code>npm install</code> in order to get the latest changes.</p>
