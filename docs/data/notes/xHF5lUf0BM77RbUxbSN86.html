<p>DDNS is a method of automatically updating a nameserver in the Domain Name System with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information.</p>
<pre><code>- each time your IP address changes, a program redirects the new address to the domain name and makes it permanently available on the internet.
</code></pre>
<p>DDNS solves the problem of having your public IP address change. Since getting a static public IP address from an ISP can be expensive, this is another solution to that problem.</p>
<p>The term is used to describe two different concepts</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>dynamic DNS updating</strong> - systems that are used to update traditional DNS records without manual editing</li>
<li>?</li>
</ol>
<p>DNS is only suitable for devices that don't change their IP often.</p>
<ul>
<li>DDNS is a system that addresses the problem of rapid updates.</li>
</ul>
