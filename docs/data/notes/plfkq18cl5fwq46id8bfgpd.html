<p>Databases fall into 2 main categories: those fit for handling business logic, and those fit for handling business analytics.</p>
<p>OLAP are used for business analysis, and feed into reports that help the management of a company make better decisions (ie. business intelligence)</p>
<p>OLTP are used to handle business logic in the application.</p>

<p>In the past, both OLTP and OLAP operations were done on the same SQL databases, but soon after it was realized that analytics data should be stored in its own database. This is what are known as <a href="/notes/3NfgHUUU25MfpnbtOJfr9">data warehouses</a> today.</p>
