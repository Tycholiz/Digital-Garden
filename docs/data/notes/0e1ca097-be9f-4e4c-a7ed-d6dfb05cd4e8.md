This Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their
sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.

For instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,
`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`
(strategies), `inner` etc.

The goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective
of a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information
from a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions
and hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query
`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.

This wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these
domains, I have been sensitive to the aha moments and have noted down my
insights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I
considered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.

The ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any
given domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for
whatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all
vague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am
trying to reach.
