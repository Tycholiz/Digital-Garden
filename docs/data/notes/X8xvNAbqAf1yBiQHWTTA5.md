### Credentials
For cross-origin requests, `credentials` allows us (as the client) to specify whether or not credentials should be sent along for the ride in HTTP requests.
- Therefore this gets set on the client.

Credentials are cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates. Basically, like the email/password credentials we are most familiar with, credentials verify identity and are a way to establish trust.

Both the client and the server must indicate that theyâ€™re opting into including credentials.
