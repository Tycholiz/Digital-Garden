A register is quickly accessible storage available to the computer's processors
most computers load data from a larger memory into registers where it is used for arithmetic operations
- manipulated data is then stored as RAM
registers are at the top of the memory hierarchy, meaning they provide the fastest access to data
registers measure how much data they can hold in terms of bits (ex. 64-bit register)
- ARM instructions operate only on registers with a few instructions for loading and saving data from / to memory while x86 can operate directly on memory as well.
- when discussing 32bit or 64-bit architectures, we are referring to the size of the register
