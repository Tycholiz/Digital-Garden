When you are designing a database with relations, you have to consider that the database is a living object. At any moment in time, you have definitions and purposes of each specific model. However, as the needs of the database change and grow with your business, you need to be flexible to change the definition of models that no longer makes sense, given that business logic
- For instance, we previously had the concept of a payment profile in the database, which was basically a credit card. Therefore, you might find a payment profile as "a way to pay". However, within corporations have coupons into the payment system, it became apparent that a coupon was really not to do similar from a credit card in the way that it would function. Therefore, it made sense to Change the way that we thought of a payment profile. Incorporating coupons into this model met reconsidering the name. Instead of payment profile, they would be called payment methods. Now the definition became something more like "some type of exchange good that you can pay with to receive a good in return". By allowing this definition to change, we were able to leverage existing functionality to incorporate new and unexpected designs into the database model.
