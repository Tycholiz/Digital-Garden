Virtual memory is when the hierarchy of storage managed by the [[os.kernel]]. It is achieved when the kernel is in charge of the [[memory hierarchy|memory#memory-hierarchy,1:#*]]

Virtual memory is typically segregated into user space and kernel space. Access rights are required to access and execute programs.
- this provides us with memory protection and hardware protection from malicious or errant software behaviour.
