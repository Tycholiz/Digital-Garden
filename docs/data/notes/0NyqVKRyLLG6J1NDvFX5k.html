<ul>
<li>When user logs in, the server creates a session for the user, and stores it a database of some sort. The server then sends the sessionId to the client, and it is stored in a cookie. That cookie gets sent with each request to the server, where it is checked against what is in the db.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sessions are stateful (unlike <a href="/Digital-Garden/notes/6s5Oh0DUcMsShcFrmDaBK">JWTs</a>, which are stateless)</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that one of the communicating parties must keep track of (store) information about the current state, and save information about session history.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sessions piggyback off of stateless HTTP requests to make a stateful connection.</p>
<ul>
<li>anal: the way TCP piggybacks on top of IP</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is an active session, the server responds to the request with an ETag (entity tag), which is an id corresponding to a particular "version" of data. If the data arrives and it is identical to the ETag, then we know it is the same as the cached version.</p>
<p>In a session-based workflow, a session is active until the user hits the logout button</p>
<p>sessions are not an option for mobile apps.</p>

<p>a place to store all session-related data (but persistent so it doesn't get erased when the user closes the tab or app)</p>
<ul>
<li>session store is like the next evolution after cookies. Cookies were being used to remember user's preferences and some searching data about them. When those client-side cookies reached their capacity, session storage starting taking over for that sort of data storage about a user.</li>
</ul>
