Components add behaviour and functionality to an object.
"component" in this sense is like "component of a GameObject". Another good word would be "aspect", as in "these are aspects of the object that give it *these* characteristics

spec: Components would be implemented as methods on an object. A component is a kind of capability of the object. For instance a spatial object has a component of `transform`. That is, it can be positioned, rotated, and scaled.
