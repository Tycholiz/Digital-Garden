A resistor controls the electric current as it passes through them. 
- The colour-coded lines are used to determine their value.

Resistors have many uses including: 
1. reduce current flow
2. adjust signal levels
3. divide voltages. This happens when resistors are lined up in series with each other. 

Resistors dissipate electrical power as heat
- For bigger applications like a motor, this is exactly what they are used for.
