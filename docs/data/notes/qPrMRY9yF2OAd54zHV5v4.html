<p>Vim uses syntax definitions to highlight source code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax definitions simply declare where a function name starts, which pieces are commented out and what are keywords.</li>
<li>To color them, Vim uses colorschemes. You can load custom color schemes by placing them in .vim/colors, then load them using the colorscheme command</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pasting">Pasting<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pasting"></a></h3>
<p>when you paste text into your terminal-based Vim with a right mouse click, Vim cannot know it is coming from a paste. To Vim, it looks like text entered by someone who can type incredibly fast :) Since Vim thinks this is regular key strokes, it applies all auto-indenting and auto-expansion of defined abbreviations to the input, resulting in often cascading indents of paragraphs.</p>
<p>There is an easy option to prevent this, however. You can temporarily switch to “paste mode”, simply by setting the following option:
<code>set pastetoggle=&#x3C;F2></code></p>
<p>Then, when in insert mode, ready to paste, if you press <code>&#x3C;F2></code>, Vim will switch to paste mode, disabling all kinds of smartness and just pasting a whole buffer of text. Then, you can disable paste mode again with another press of <code>&#x3C;F2></code>. Nice and simple.</p>
