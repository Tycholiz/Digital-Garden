<p>A router is essentially just a container for a set of middleware, grouped by the fact they all have to do with http methods and routes</p>
<ul>
<li>The router is an isolated (meaning it operates independently of other routers) instance of middleware and routes. Therefore it can only perform middleware and routing functions.</li>
<li>The router can be thought of as a mini-application</li>
<li>A route is a combination of a path and a callback (called the route-handler)</li>
</ul>
