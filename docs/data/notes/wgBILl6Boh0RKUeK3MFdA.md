A repeater is a networked device that broadcasts the same data out of each of its ports and lets each device decide what data they need
- since repeaters amplify a signal, they need a source of electric power

Repeaters operate on [[L1|network.osi-model#l1-physical,1:#*]] of the OSI model, since they do not try to interpret the data being transmitted
- anal: in Lord of the Rings, Gondor has a series of beacons that can be lit to communicate to the whole kingdom that war has been declared. Each repeater (beacon) receives a signal and retransmits it (by lighting up their own beacon)
