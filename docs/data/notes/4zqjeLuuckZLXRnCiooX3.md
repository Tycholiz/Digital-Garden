A JTBD is a prototype that one aspires to be. This prototype is designed by a company. The company will design a product that creates in you a "desire" to get a certain job done. By virtue of the process, the product then becomes the only means of fulfilling that new need and thereby "getting the job done".
- Progress can only happen when we attach and integrate new ideas and new products into our lives. This is the basis for why people gain new jobs to be done. 
- When people start to understand there is a new *job to be done*, they start imagining the product integrated in their life, along with all of the benefits that the product provides.
- Having a JTBD is a process. A JTBD is not a thing that consumers have, but rather something that they participate in (an analogy is falling in love, which is something we participate in.)
- A JTBD is distinct from a task (which would be something like "search a song and add it to your playlist").
- A JTBD describes "a better me". It answers the question, “How are you better since you started using [product]?”

- People use only one solution at a time for a JTBD.
- People that are in the process of discovering a solution to a JTBD engage in a mental simulation of that product helping them become better.
- People don't want the product — they want help making their lives better.
- JTBD is a useful framework because it helps you keep your mind on what core value you add to the customer's life. This drives innovation in the right direction. 
    - If you were a company that made horse-drawn carriages before cars were made, you should have realized at some point that the job to be done for your customers was to have specific (and imaginable) benefits that arise from being able to travel fast. As long as your product is doing the best job it can in satisfying that customer's job to be done, they will remain a client. As cars come along, customers would have much to gain by switching from your horse-drawn carriage, since the car helps the customer become more efficient in fulfilling his job to be done.

    - All these options aren't describing the product, but are rather describing progress (how can you improve as a result of using the product).
