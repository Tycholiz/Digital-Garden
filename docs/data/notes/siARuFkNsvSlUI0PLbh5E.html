<p>RAM works by means of fast-switching pointers. This is analogous to how information retrieval from a database is so efficient. The engine doesn't really care what the data is it's retrievingâ€” it only cares about getting it out.</p>

<ul>
<li>the temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while the processor is executing the program.</li>
<li>physically, main memory consists of a collection of DRAM chips.</li>
<li>logically, memory is organized as a linear array of bytes, each with its own array index starting at 0.</li>
<li>ex. Imagine every spot of RAM having its own address.
<ul>
<li>If your computer is 32 bit (4,294,967,296), then our computer can't talk to any address that is higher than that.
<ul>
<li>This much memory is commonly known as 4gb.</li>

<p>Sometimes, the physical RAM runs short for actively running programs. When this happens, a block of space on the hard drive can be configured by the OS to pretend to be memory.</p>
<p>Of course, virtual RAM is a lot slower, so the more your computer is forced to rely on it, the less performant it will be</p>
