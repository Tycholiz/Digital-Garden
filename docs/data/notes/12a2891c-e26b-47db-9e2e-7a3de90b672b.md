## Deciding when it should be a class
The fact that something sounds like an object does not automatically mean that it should be an object in your program. Reflexively writing classes for every concept in your application tends to leave you with a collection of interconnected objects that each have their own internal, changing state. Such programs are often hard to understand and thus easy to break.
- This is in reference to a program that simulates a village with roads between houses, and a robot that delivers parcels to each house. The program has to track the state of the parcel delivery status, as well as the robot's location in the town. Consider that if our instinct was to have classes for the robot, one for a parcel, maybe one for places, we would have to hold state in objects of different classes. The robot's current location would probably be held in the `Robot` class, while the delivery status of a parcel would probably be held in the `Parcel` class. Furthermore, a location would probably hold the state of all the parcels that are currently delivered to it. Having this state spread out everywhere makes the program hard to understand (and know which of these objects will need to have their state updated).

When considering how granular we should make our classes, it makes sense to think high-level. Ask the question, "how can I represent the state of this program in a central and simple way, where I can update the state in a single place in the event of a business-level action (such as moving location, dropping off a letter etc)". If we had a postman program, which mails a stack of letters to different householders, a natural inclination might be for us to create classes for postman, village etc. Instead, we should consider what the minimal scope of state is. In this example, we only really need to keep track of how many letters there are, and where the current location is. Realistically, all we need is a `VillageState` class.
```js
class VillageState {
  constructor(place, parcels) {
    this.place = place;
    this.parcels = parcels;
  }

  move(destination) {
    if (!roadGraph[this.place].includes(destination)) {
      return this;
    } else {
      let parcels = this.parcels
        .map(p => {
          if (p.place != this.place) return p;
          return {place: destination, address: p.address};
        })
        .filter(p => p.place != p.address);
      return new VillageState(destination, parcels);
    }
  }
}
```

Let's apply the above lesson to TicTacToe. If we were to blindly make every item into it's own object, we would have classes for `Game`, `Board`, `Player`, `Square`. Resisting that temptation, think about how we might go about centralizing the state and the methods that change them. For instance, we don't really need a `Square` class. The duty of a `Square` class presumably is to keep track of the square's current state (empty, X, 0). But this could just as easily be managed by the same class that represents the `Board`. If we used a `Square` class, then we would have to reach into it every time we want to make a calculation about the state of the game.
- spec: when deciding on what classes to make, think in terms of what state you need to store, and at what level would be appropriate?
  - ex. in TicTacToe, it might make sense to model a `Player` class, if you are going to use it to determine each player's currently occupied squares (ex. `[0, 4, 7]`). Alternatively, you may decide that that data can be safely stored in the `Game` object as 2 properties, `player1Choices` and `player2Choices`.

In OOP, dependencies are things that you need to provide to the constructor of the class to create an instance of it.

## Example: Implementing TicTacToe
Create a player, game, and board class. The player class will choose moves, the board class will hold the state of the moves, and the game class will run the game and declare the winner.

If you want to make this project more challenging then make sure the game class can accept either human or computer players (and the code is exactly the same from the game class's perspective). This will allow you to practice class inheritance and also you can learn to build a simple ai. For the ai you can start with a simple computer that picks randomly. Once you get that done you can basically build a tree structure which builds all the possible future outcomes and make sure the computer selects the most favorable one.
