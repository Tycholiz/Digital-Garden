<p>A webhook is a callback living on a 3rd party server that sends an HTTP request upon some event.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Twilio providing an Express server with SMS as they arrive to the Twilio server
Webhooks are a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information</li>
<li>ex. with Twilio, whenever their servers receieve an SMS, they will call the webhook endpoint that we provide to them. their webhook is a POST request, that will match up with a POST route that we define on our app server.</li>
<li>The key difference with a webhook is the use of callbacks. In traditional APIs, we manually have to poll for data in order to get a real-time experience. </li>
<li>Webhooks can be thought of as "reverse APIs", as they give you the API spec, and you must design the API for them to use.
<ul>
<li>Put another way, the webhook makes an API request to your app, which you must handle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To make the connection, the webhook provider (ex. Twilio) must be provided with the address that it will send the requests to.
<ul>
<li>Therefore, your app must have a publicly accessible url for the webhook to work (ie. localhost will not work)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Metaphorically, webhooks are like a phone number that Stripe calls to notify you of activity in your Stripe account</p>
<ul>
<li>The webhook endpoint is the person answering that call who takes actions based upon the specific information it receives.</li>
</ul>
<p>A webhook on our server says "hey, I want you to call this number (<code>/webhook</code> url) when <em>this</em> event happens"</p>
