<p>Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications</p>
<ul>
<li>use <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to configure the app's services, and start them with a single command
<ul>
<li>this file will be parsed everytime you run <code>docker-compose up</code>. Therefore, if you make changes to <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, all you need to do is <code>docker-compose down</code>, then <code>dc up</code> again. This is unlike the Dockerfile, which will only be run once when you are building an image</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>using compose is a 3 step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define your appâ€™s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.</li>
<li>Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.</li>
<li>Run docker-compose up and Compose starts and runs your entire app.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start, stop, and rebuild services</li>
<li>View the status of running services</li>
<li>Stream the log output of running services</li>
<li>Run a one-off command on a service</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-docker-composeyml">Anatomy of docker-compose.yml<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#anatomy-of-docker-composeyml"></a></h2>
<p>This file will be run with <code>docker-compose up</code>, building up the services (and with it, the containers) of the whole application</p>
<ul>
<li>if the image has already been built, then by default the build command will be ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>The docker-compose.yml file is organized by service. The <code>build</code> field designates the location of the service's dockerfile (this location is called the "build context") so that it can be run and the image can be built.</p>
<p>the docker-compose.yml file can specify environment variables to be executed during process of building the images with the <code>args</code> field under <code>build</code></p>
<ul>
<li>these variables are accessed in the dockerfiles by specifying <code>arg</code>:</li>
</ul>
<p>dockerfile:</p>
<pre class="language-yml"><code class="language-yml">arg buildno
arg gitcommithash

<span class="token key atrule">run echo "build number</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> $buildno"
<span class="token key atrule">run echo "based on commit</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> $gitcommithash"
</code></pre>
<p>docker-compose.yml</p>
<pre class="language-yml"><code class="language-yml"><span class="token key atrule">build</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token key atrule">context</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> .
  <span class="token key atrule">args</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">buildno</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">1</span>
    <span class="token key atrule">gitcommithash</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> cdc3b19
</code></pre>
<h3 id="publish-vs-expose">Publish vs. EXPOSE<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#publish-vs-expose"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>these commands make the services inside the containers available to outside the containers</li>
<li>expose makes the processes in the container accessible to other containers within Docker (but not from <em>outside</em> Docker)
<ul>
<li>note: this is not entirely correct, but useful for understanding. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22111060/what-is-the-difference-between-expose-and-publish-in-docker/47594352#47594352">see</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>publish (<code>-p</code>) makes the services available to outside Docker
<ul>
<li>Therefore, publish implicitly EXPOSES</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service">Service<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#service"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>there is one image per service, but there can be multiple containers for a service. In other words, a docker "service" is one or more containers from one image</li>
<li>In our development set up, we are likely to have a single container per image. When we start to scale and need for additional containers per service arises, we can use <code>docker service</code> to create multiple containers from the same image
<ul>
<li>consider how this relates to the <code>docker run</code> command, which starts up 1+ containers from an equal amount of image (ie. one container per image)</li>
<li>what arises from running this command is Docker's swarm mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swarm mode is a container orchestration tool, giving the user the ability to manage multiple containers deployed across many different host machines
<ul>
<li>ex. imagine there are 5 containers deplayed across 5 different machines across USA. Swarm mode allows you to interact with all 5 containers at once, instead of having to manage one container at a time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This above distinction between a container and a service is precicely what differentiates <code>docker exec</code> and <code>docker-compose run</code>
<ul>
<li>naturally, <code>docker-compose</code> runs <code>docker</code> commands under the hood.</li>
<li><code>docker exec</code> exectutes a command within a docker container</li>
<li><code>docker-compose run</code> executes a command on a service (with the help of a swarm manager(?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
