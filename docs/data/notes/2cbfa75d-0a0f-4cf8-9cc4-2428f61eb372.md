A Github Action is installed as soon as we have a `.github/workflows` directory committed to our repo on Github.

## Terminology

### Workflow
A workflow is an automated procedure that exists as a part of our repo.
- Workflows are made up of a collection of jobs which run is response to some event (on PR, on push etc)

A Github Workflow can be used to build, test, package, release, or deploy a project on GitHub.

Workflows can be configured to run in response to a webhook call, so we can trigger workflows in response to events happening outside Github.

### Job
A job is a set of steps that execute on a single runner
A workflow with multiple jobs will run those jobs in parallel by default (configurable)
Each job in a workflow runs in a fresh virtual environment

### Step
A step is an individual task that can run commands in a job

A step can either be:
- a shell command
- an action

Each step in a job executes on the same runner, allowing the actions in that job to share data with each other.

### Action
Actions are standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job
Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow. You can create your own actions, or use actions created by the GitHub community

### Runner
A runner is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed
- meaning we could use the managed service from Github, or self-host the Runner.

A runner listens for available jobs, runs one job at a time, and reports the progress, logs, and results back to GitHub

GitHub-hosted runners are based on Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS

### Secrets
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered.
- Aside from this, no other secrets are passed by default, and must be configured manually.

To provide an action with a secret (either as input or as an env variable), use the `secrets` context.
- This allows us to access secrets we've created in our repo.
- [more info](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions)

Secrets should not be passed between processes via the command line, as these commands might be visible to other users with the `ps` command.
- This is why we use `STDIN` or env variables to pass secrets.
