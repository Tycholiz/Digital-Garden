<ul>
<li>There are 2 main threads in a RN app: the main thread  and the javascript thread
<ul>
<li>The main thread runs on native platforms and handles displaying the elements of the UI and processes user gestures.</li>
<li>The JS thread executes JS code in a separate JS engine 
<ul>
<li>Therefore, it deals with the business logic of the app</li>
<li>Also, it defines the structure and functionality of the UI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These 2 threads never communicate directly and never block each other</li>
<li>Between these 2 threads is the bridge, which has 3 characteristics:
<ol>
<li>Asynchronous communication between the threads</li>
<li>Batched communication between threads</li>
<li>Serializable, meaning the threads never operate on the same dataâ€” instead exchanging serialized messages</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
