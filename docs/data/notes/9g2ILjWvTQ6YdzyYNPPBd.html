<p>IC is contrasted with Discrete Circuit (such as a PCB)</p>
<ul>
<li>an IC is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material (normally silicon)</li>
<li>The integration of large numbers of tiny MOS transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components.</li>
<li>ICs can be seen as a building block approach to integrated circuit design 
<ul>
<li>This has resulted in discrete transistors being far more rare on the PCB itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a modern chip (year 2020) may have many billions of MOS transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail</li>
</ul>
