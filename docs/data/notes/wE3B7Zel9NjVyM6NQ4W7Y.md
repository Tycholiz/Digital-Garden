Actions available on the panel that appears when in debugging mode

### Continue
Move along to the next debugger point

### Step Over
Call the function without causing our debugging context to be inside the function call
- Therefore, if we are at a function and "step over", we will not enter the function. However, the function itself will of course still be executed.

### Step Into
Go into the current function and execute each line within 1 by 1

### Step Out
Exit the current function debugger context.
