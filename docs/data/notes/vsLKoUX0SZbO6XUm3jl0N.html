<p>A network bridge is a networking device that creates a single network from multiple networks.</p>
<pre><code>- This process is called *network bridging*

<ul>
<li>Bridging differs from routing, since routing allows multiple networks to communicate independently and yet remain separate.

<li>On the other hand, bridging connects two separate networks as if they were a single network</li>
</ul>
