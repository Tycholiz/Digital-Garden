## Debugging outbound network issues
1. Sources tab, hit `Pause on exceptions` (stop sign with pause icon)
2. Reload the page, and code will pause on the first exception that happens
3. Hover over the failing line, and investigate
	- are args to the function call what you'd expect them to be? Does anything stand out? Why is an error being thrown?
