<p>Queues are very similar to stacks in that they both are linear data structures with dynamic size. However, queues are FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structures, like a line to a rollercoaster. That is, first come, first serve.</p>
<p>Along with stacks, queues are the most the basic list types in computing</p>
<p>A queue has a number of useful applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a resource is shared by multiple consumers</li>
<li>Create directories</li>
<li>When data is transferring asynchronously between two resources</li>
</ul>
