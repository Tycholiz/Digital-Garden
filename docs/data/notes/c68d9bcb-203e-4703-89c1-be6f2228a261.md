# View
- A view is like a derived table, but instead of it only living within the context of a single query, it exists more in perpetuity 
	- in other words, it is the result set of a stored query
	- users of the database can query the view just as they would query any other table
- while a view is a virtualized table that represents the result of a particular db query, when a query is made against a view, that query is converted into a query that can be made against the base table (in other words, the underlying base table(s) that the view is based off of)
	- *materialized view* - in contrast to the way a view is queried, a materialized view actually takes up storage space, making it a proper table (and not just a conceptual table). When you query a materialized view, the result set is cached and stored (or, materialized) as a sort of pseudo table 
		- can be thought of as a snapshot of a query set
		- makes queries more efficient at the expense of space
