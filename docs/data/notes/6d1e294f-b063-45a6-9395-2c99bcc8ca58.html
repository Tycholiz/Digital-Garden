<ul>
<li>A network bridge is a networking device that creates a single network from multiple networks.
<ul>
<li>This process is called <em>network bridging</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bridging differs from routing, since routing allows multiple networks to communicate independently and yet remain separate.
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, bridging connects two separate networks as if they were a single network</li>
</ul>
