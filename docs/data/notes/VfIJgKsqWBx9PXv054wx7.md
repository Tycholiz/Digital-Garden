### Root nameserver
- Accepts the domain name from the DNS resolver, and returns the appropriate TLD address (`.com`, etc.). The resolver then uses this to find the TLD nameserver.
- The "root" here is a reference to the `.` in `.com`. If you think of the `.` as a `/` instead, it becomes clear why it's called root (it is a directory)
- There are 13 types of root nameservers (therefore 13 different addresses)
- ex. **F-Root Server**
- overseen by ICANN
