The root nameservers know where the authoritative nameservers for each of the top-level [[zones|dns.db.zone]] are. 

When queried, the root nameserver accepts the domain name and returns the names and addresses of the nameservers that are authoritative for the top-level zone the domain name ends in (e.g. `com`)

There are 13 types of root nameservers (therefore 13 different addresses). They are overseen by ICANN
- ex. **F-Root Server**
