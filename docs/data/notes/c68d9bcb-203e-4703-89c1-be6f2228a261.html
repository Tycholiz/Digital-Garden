<ul>
<li>A view is like a derived table, but instead of it only living within the context of a single query, it exists more in perpetuity 
<ul>
<li>in other words, it is the result set of a stored query</li>
<li>users of the database can query the view just as they would query any other table</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>while a view is a virtualized table that represents the result of a particular db query, when a query is made against a view, that query is converted into a query that can be made against the base table (in other words, the underlying base table(s) that the view is based off of)
<ul>
<li><em>materialized view</em> - in contrast to the way a view is queried, a materialized view actually takes up storage space, making it a proper table (and not just a conceptual table). When you query a materialized view, the result set is cached and stored (or, materialized) as a sort of pseudo table 
<ul>
<li>can be thought of as a snapshot of a query set</li>
<li>makes queries more efficient at the expense of space  </li>
</ul>
