<p>Pipelines are the top-level component of continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.</p>
<p>A pipeline is a set of instructions (ie. <a href="/notes/00Zg2MBUOK3gzRljklTOp">Jobs</a>) that are executed in an order that we define</p>
<p>A merge request can have many pipelines, and each pipeline must belong to one merge request.</p>
<p>Normally a pipeline is created when you push to a branch on Gitlab</p>
<p>Pipelines comprise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jobs, which define what to do. For example, jobs that compile or test code.</li>
<li>Stages, which define when to run the jobs. For example, stages that run tests after stages that compile the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all jobs in a stage succeed, the pipeline moves on to the next stage.</p>
<p>If any job in a stage fails, the next stage is not executed and the pipeline ends early.</p>
<ul>
<li>we can set a job to <code>allow_failure: true</code> if we want to override this behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical pipeline might consist of four stages, executed in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>A test stage, with two jobs called unittest and lint.</li>
<li>A build stage, with a job called compile.</li>
<li>A staging stage, with a job called deploy-to-stage.</li>
<li>A production stage, with a job called deploy-to-prod.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-pipeline">Types of Pipeline<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#types-of-pipeline"></a></h2>
<p>Pipelines come in various configurations</p>
<h3 id="basic-pipelines-ie-branch-pipelines">Basic pipelines (ie. Branch Pipelines)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#basic-pipelines-ie-branch-pipelines"></a></h3>
<p>run everything in each stage concurrently, followed by the next stage. Run the pipeline each time changes are pushed to a branch.</p>
<p>Basic pipelines have some characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>they run when you push a new commit to a branch.</li>
<li>they have access to some predefined variables.</li>
<li>they have access to protected variables and protected runners.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="merge-request-pipelines">Merge Request Pipelines<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#merge-request-pipelines"></a></h3>
<p>Run only when commits associated with an MR are pushed (rather than for every commit).</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge Request jobs run in a separate pipeline from Commit jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pipelines for merge requests run when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new merge request.</li>
<li>Commit changes to the source branch for the merge request.</li>
<li>Select the Run pipeline button from the Pipelines tab in the merge request.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that if you use a squash-based workflow, jobs in the MR pipelines (ie. those associated with each commit to that MR) will have run on a different commit than the commit that actually gets merged into the <code>main</code> branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>remember that in a squash-based workflow, all the commits that went into that MR will not make its way into the repo's history. Consider that if we have a job that depends on a git commit SHA (e.g. a <code>contract-test</code> job that records the publication of the contract by the commit SHA), we cannot perform this job in the MR pipeline alone, because the contract testing framework (here, <a href="/notes/Jhamjiy0mDIq6zImBiDTj">Pact</a>) will only be aware of the commit SHA-related contracts that are associated with those commits that will never make its way into the main commit history line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Merge Request Pipelines don't run by default; they <em>must</em> be configured with <code>rules</code> or <code>only/except</code> (old method)</p>
<p>Jobs of a merge request pipeline only run on the contents of the source branch, ignoring the target branch.</p>
<p>Merge Request Pipelines also have access to additional <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html#predefined-variables-for-merge-request-pipelines">pre-defined variables</a> </p>
<p>Merge Request Pipelines display the <code>merge request</code> tag:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-08-25-09-54-07.png"></p>
<h3 id="git-tag-pipelines">Git Tag Pipelines<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#git-tag-pipelines"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>note: "git tag pipeline" is not an official type of pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>A pipeline that runs once a git tag has been created

<h3 id="merged-requests-pipeline">Merged Requests Pipeline<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#merged-requests-pipeline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>note the merge<strong>d</strong> request<strong>s</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>merge request pipelines that act as though the changes from the source branch have already been merged into the target branch.</p>
<h3 id="merge-trains">Merge Trains<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#merge-trains"></a></h3>
<p>Merge trains use pipelines for merged results to queue merges one after the other.</p>
<h3 id="directed-acyclic-graph-pipeline-dag">Directed Acyclic Graph Pipeline (DAG)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#directed-acyclic-graph-pipeline-dag"></a></h3>
<p>pipelines are based on relationships between jobs and can run more quickly than basic pipelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>we achieve this with the <code>needs</code> keyword, which allows us to be explicit about the job's dependencies 
<ul>
<li>ex. a post-install stage <em>needs</em> an install stage to have succeeded first</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-project-pipelines">Multi-project pipelines<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#multi-project-pipelines"></a></h3>
<p>combine pipelines for different projects together.</p>
<h3 id="parent-child-pipelines">Parent-Child pipelines<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#parent-child-pipelines"></a></h3>
<p>break down complex pipelines into one parent pipeline that can trigger multiple child sub-pipelines, which all run in the same project and with the same SHA. This pipeline architecture is commonly used for mono-repos.</p>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*.
