<p>A greedy algorithm always takes the best/cheapest option available at that moment, even if that might not be the best way to go from an overall point of view.</p>
<p>A greedy algorithm is one that picks the best option at the moment, even if doing so means missing better choices later on.</p>
<p>A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that tries to maximize its gain each step of the way, instead of seeking out the overall best solution.</p>
<p>The opposite of a greedy algorithm is a dynamic algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>greedy algorithm</em> would say "I need to make my way from point A to point Z, so at every step in-between I look for the adjacent vertex closest to Z and move there." It's easy to program and will probably get the job done but it doesn't guarantee that you've found the shortest path.</li>
<li><em>Dynamic algorithm</em> says "I go to every node and make a note of the distance to each adjacent node and see if it's shorter than any previously known shortest path to that node. Once I've figured out the shortest path to every node then I can easily lookup the shortest path from A to Z." So, for example we see that A-B-C-D-E gets us to E in five steps, and we know that A-F gets us to F in one step, and then we see that E connects to F so we update our records to say the shortest path from A to E is A-F-E instead of A-B-C-D-E. Continue doing this until you have found the shortest paths from any node to any other node.</li>
</ul>

<p>if your algorithm was about packing differently sized boxes into a van, the algorithm would always choose to put the biggest box that could fit in the vanâ€” even if we could achieve a higher cumulative volume by using a combination of smaller boxes.</p>

<p>Say you're dropped off in the the woods and want to find the highest point in the area so you can have a look around. A greedy algorithm would be to look at your immediate surroundings and pick the direction that has the highest slope, then travel that direction for a bit and repeat. This will usually get you to the top of a hill, but you can't be sure it's the highest hill. Mount Everest could be on the other side of the ravine you started next to, but you'll never find it because your algorithm never chooses a direction that descends.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#example-packing-boxes-in-vans" title="Example: Packing boxes in vans">Example: Packing boxes in vans</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#example-highest-altitude" title="Example: Highest altitude">Example: Highest altitude</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></section></section></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"aZw9FYSMLg1GIrQyqE2Ee","title":"Greedy","desc":"","updated":1638140527470,"created":1638139712081,"custom":{},"fname":"general.terms.greedy","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"},"contentHash":"3f3799dd6864523ffe0e5602609a5bcf","links":[],"anchors":{"example-packing-boxes-in-vans":{"type":"header","text":"Example: Packing boxes in vans","value":"example-packing-boxes-in-vans","line":18,"column":0,"depth":3},"example-highest-altitude":{"type":"header","text":"Example: Highest altitude","value":"example-highest-altitude","line":21,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":[],"parent":"77d8d8d6-4f2a-4b0f-85f6-7f50f1175b3a","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"greedy\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#greedy\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eGreedy\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA greedy algorithm always takes the best/cheapest option available at that moment, even if that might not be the best way to go from an overall point of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA greedy algorithm is one that picks the best option at the moment, even if doing so means missing better choices later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA greedy algorithm is an algorithm that tries to maximize its gain each step of the way, instead of seeking out the overall best solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opposite of a greedy algorithm is a dynamic algorithm:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe \u003cem\u003egreedy algorithm\u003c/em\u003e would say \"I need to make my way from point A to point Z, so at every step in-between I look for the adjacent vertex closest to Z and move there.\" It's easy to program and will probably get the job done but it doesn't guarantee that you've found the shortest path.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDynamic algorithm\u003c/em\u003e says \"I go to every node and make a note of the distance to each adjacent node and see if it's shorter than any previously known shortest path to that node.

Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"aZw9FYSMLg1GIrQyqE2Ee"},"buildId":"s-Pdpb0Y8fVIEUakhzEMN","assetPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
