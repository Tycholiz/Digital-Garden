<p>A commit is the immutable state of a folder structure at a given point in time. It is a snapshot— not a diff</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a misconception that Git stores diffs, since we see diffs when using github, or using common commands like <code>git diff</code>. However, these diffs are dynamically generated, given 2 different commit snapshots. In fact, we can see a diff of any 2 commits. If Git stored diffs, we wouldn't be able to see a diff between 2 commits that are far apart from each other.
<ul>
<li>Under the hood, Git is comparing the root <a href="/notes/J9Z9E8d7dzzJA7BiOVy8W">trees</a> of each commit, and taking note of the paths that have different Object Ids
<ul>
<li>ex. if we have 2 commits and the only different is an edit made in the README, Git is able to get that diff by introspecting on the trees, and noticing that the objects representing that README file have different OIDs. When the OIDs do not match, it means they have different contents</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You tell Git you want to save a snapshot of your project with <code>git commit</code> and it basically records a manifest of what all of the files in your project look like at that point</p>
<pre><code>- Most of the git commands interact with those manifests in some way
</code></pre>
<p>We can think about Git as a tool for storing, comparing and merging snapshots of our project</p>
<ul>
<li>We can get a snapshot of an individual file with <code>git checkout &#x3C;Commit SHA> &#x3C;filename></code></li>
<li>A snapshot is basically a commit</li>
<li>Snapshot is to a repository as screenshot is to a video, since it represents one moment of time in that video</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aheadbehind">Ahead/Behind<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#aheadbehind"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If your current branch is 3 commits <em>ahead</em> of master, it means the current branch has 3 commits that don't exist on master</li>
<li>If the current branch is 3 commits <em>behind</em> master, it means there are 3 commits on master that don't exit on the current branch</li>
<li>The ahead number tells you roughly how much impact the current branch will have on the base branch should it be merged.</li>
<li>The behind number tells you how much work has happened on the base branch since this branch was started.
<ul>
<li>If the number is high, it's an indication that there will not be a clean merge. This would be a good time to merge master (or other base branch) into the current branch, which would bring the "behind" number to 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the follow diagram:
<ul>
<li>A is 2 commits behind and 0 commits ahead of B</li>
<li>B is 0 commits behind and 2 commits ahead of A</li>
<li>C is 1 commit behind and 2 commits ahead of A</li>
<li>C is 3 commits behind and 2 commits ahead of B</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="detached-state">Detached State<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#detached-state"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Occurs when we check out a commit or a remote branch, as opposed to a local branch.
<ul>
<li>Put another way, any ref that does not originate from your line of commits (and would thus be unable to trace any sort of history with the code you'd been working on)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we were to develop in detached mode then try to merge it into master, git would complain to us, because by definition, detached mode means there is no path to get back into master. (ie. there is no way to reference that feature "branch")</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fast-forward-commit">Fast-Forward commit<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fast-forward-commit"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Occurs when we tell git to merge our feature branch into master, but git realizes that there are no 2 branches to merge, but instead the master just needs to be brought up to speed to the current feature branch. This is known as <em>fast-forwarding</em></li>
<li>effectively what is happening is Git engine is moving the current branch tip up to the target branch tip.</li>
<li>If the tip of master hasn't moved since we branched off, no merge commit will be made. The HEAD will simply move to the most recent commit of the feature branch.
<ul>
<li>In a ff merge scenario, since the master has not changed since we branched, a "merging/melding" of branches is not relevant here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forcing-a-ff-merge">Forcing a FF Merge<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#forcing-a-ff-merge"></a></h3>
<p>This ff may not be desirable. Imagine we want to merge in a branch called <em>oauth</em>. This is a pretty significant feature, and we'd like to keep the branch in our history. This is a scenario where we can merge with <code>--no-ff</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>non fast-forwarding</em></strong> (a.k.a <em>3 way merge</em>) ex. - we create a feature branch from master. We do some work on feature, then decide to merge into master. Since we had branched off from master, other feature branches have been merged into master. This means the git engine has to figure out how to <em>merge</em> the master branch (which is now different from how our feature remembers it) and our feature branch.
<ul>
<li>If this were a <em>fast-forward merge</em>, then there would have been no merges into master during the time that our feature branch existed.</li>
</ul>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"yMzID31DyN2cnh9PW7aY3"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
