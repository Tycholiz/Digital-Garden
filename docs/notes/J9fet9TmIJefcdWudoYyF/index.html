<h3 id="server-certificate">Server certificate<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#server-certificate"></a></h3>
<p>In order to establish a secure connection between client and server, the server must provide a digital certificate, proving their identity to the client.</p>
<p>The client then conducts <em>certification path validation</em>, ensuring that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The subject of the certificate matches the host name (not to be confused with the domain name) to which the client is trying to connect.</li>
<li>A trusted certificate authority has signed the certificate.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the certificate path starts with the <code>Subject</code> certificate, and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the client has validated successfully, a secure connection is established between it and the server.</p>
<p>The certificate has a <code>Subject</code> field which identifies the primary host name of the server as the <em>Common Name</em></p>
<ul>
<li>a certificate may specify more than one hostname (e.g. a domain and its subdomains), which are called <em>Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificates</em>, which contain a <code>Subject Alternative Name</code> field</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="client-certificate">Client Certificate<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#client-certificate"></a></h3>
<p>Client certificates authenticate the client connecting to a TLS service.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. To connect to Zscaler VPN, we must have a certificate issued by Zscaler in our filesystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>ex. Zscaler?</p>
<h3 id="certificate-chain">Certificate chain<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#certificate-chain"></a></h3>
<p>A certificate chain is an ordered list of certificates, containing an SSL/TLS server certificate, intermediate certificate, and <a href="/notes/GLX9Wh0NbQGCEHLaQlkdN">Certificate Authority</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 1 or more intermediate certificates, and act as middlemen between the protected root certificates and the server certificates issued out to the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we install the TLS certificate, we will also be sent an intermediate root certificate.</p>
<p>When a browser downloads our website’s TLS certificate upon arriving at our homepage, it begins chaining that certificate through the intermediate certificates, all the way back to the trusted root certificate.</p>
<ul>
<li>if it can't be chained back to a trusted root, the browser will issue a warning about the certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>To view the certificate chain for google.com, run:</p>
<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 -servername google.com
</code></pre>
<p>Example output:</p>
<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">0 s:/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google Inc/CN=*.google.com
i:/C=US/O=Google Inc/CN=Google Internet Authority G2
1 s:/C=US/O=Google Inc/CN=Google Internet Authority G2
i:/C=US/O=GeoTrust Inc./CN=GeoTrust Global CA
2 s:/C=US/O=GeoTrust Inc./CN=GeoTrust Global CA
i:/C=US/O=Equifax/OU=Equifax Secure Certificate Authority
</code></pre>
<p>Understanding the output:</p>
<ul>
<li>the numbered lines are:
<ul>
<li>0: server certificate</li>
<li>1: intermediate</li>
<li>2: root</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>s: indicates the certificate subject</li>
<li>i: indicates the issuing certificate’s subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>The certificate chain is valid if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject of each certificate matches the Issuer of the preceding certificate in the chain (except for the server certificate).</li>
<li>Subject and Issuer are the same for the root certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Subject of the intermediate certificate matches the Issuer of the server certificate.</li>
<li>The Subject of the root certificate matches the Issuer of the intermediate certificate.</li>
<li>The Subject and Issuer are the same in the root certificate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="self-signed-certificate">Self-signed Certificate<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#self-signed-certificate"></a></h3>
<p>A self-signed certificate refers to a certificate that is created and signed by the same entity whose identity it certifies </p>
<ul>
<li>ex. we create a certificate from our Synology NAS, and it is also the same NAS that certifies the machine's identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-signed certificates are signed with the private key generated by the entity</p>
<p>Because self-signed certificates are not issued by third-party certificate authorities, they provide less proof of the identity of the server and are usually only used to secure channels between the server and a group of known users.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="server-certificate-1">Server Certificate<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#server-certificate-1"></a></h2>
<p>Used to authenticate the identity of a server to the client that is trying to connect to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is the certificate that is issued to the specific domain the user is needing coverage for</li>
</ul>
<p>When a server certificate gets installed on a website, HTTPS gets enabled, and the certificate chain gets created, the result of which vouches for the authenticity of the website.</p>
<ul>
<li>When we hop on to our computers and type in a website URL, the server certificate ensures that the data flow between our client browser and the domain we’re trying to reach stays secure</li>
</ul>
<p>Also known as SSL/TLS certificates</p>
<p>Based on PKI</p>
<h2 id="client-certificate-1">Client Certificate<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#client-certificate-1"></a></h2>
<p>Used to validate the identity of a client.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this way, it serves as a password, as in theory, no one should be able to produce that certificate but the true client.</li>
<li>Client certs don't encrypt any data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Client certificates exist because passwords aren't that secure.</p>
<p>Client certificates use the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication (just as server certificates do).</p>
<ul>
<li>Difference is that client certificates don't encrypt any data; they are just for validation purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contain "Issued to" and "Issued by" fields</p>
<p>Based on PKI</p>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"J9fet9TmIJefcdWudoYyF"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
