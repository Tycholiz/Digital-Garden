<h2 id="overview">Overview<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#overview"></a></h2>
<p>A Deployment controls the deployment and running of a pod on your cluster.</p>
<p>Deployment objects manage the creation of pods for us. </p>
<ul>
<li>If we run a <a href="/notes/a9WtJDyCZ4NvEaAZ4p3bd">Kubernetes Pod</a> directly and it fails, Kubernetes will not automatically reschedule it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from rescheduling our pods when they die, Deployments can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>scale our applications by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas we have running</li>
<li>handle the rollout of new versions of our application, so we can go from v1 to v2 without any downtime. </li>
<li>allow us to easily rollback bad releases, as well as preventing bad releases from going through altogether </li>
</ul>
<p>Kubernetes Deployments are all about: how do we swap out the old <a href="/notes/DoF6o4TQOhpbUAx16L24H">ReplicaSets</a> with the new ones, and not lose any downtime in the process? How do we gently replace them 1 by 1, without having to replace them all at once?</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. Imagine that we want to start using the Docker image <code>Postgres:12.2</code> instead of <code>Postgres:11.0</code>. The deploy.yml file specifies that we want to have 3 ReplicaSets. The implication of this, is that if we run <code>kubectl set image -f deploy.yml &#x3C;containername>=postgres:12.2</code>, we would expect the Kubernetes engine to drop one <code>11.0</code> RS, and add a <code>12.2</code>, then drop another <code>11.0</code> and add a <code>12.2</code>, and so on until the rollout is complete and we only have <code>12.2</code>.
<ul>
<li>note: when we rollback (ie. undo a rollout), this process happens in reverse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine the systems of Kubernetes, Docker, and everything in between. If Docker were at the bottom of a physical chain, we could run containers ourselves with <code>docker run</code>. Moving up, we can create pods directly with `kubectl create pod</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-problem"></a></h3>
<p>With just <a href="/notes/a9WtJDyCZ4NvEaAZ4p3bd">Pods</a>, <a href="/notes/DoF6o4TQOhpbUAx16L24H">ReplicaSets</a> and <a href="/notes/ryBzcGWSKyybRXnyKxteV">Services</a>, we can deploy, scale and enable communication for our application. </p>
<ul>
<li>However, this is all useless if we cannot update those applications with new releases. This is the problem that Deployments solve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The desired state of our applications is changing all the time. The most common reasons for new states are new releases. The process is relatively simple. We make a change and commit it to a code repository. We build it, and we test it. Once we’re confident that it works as expected, we deploy it to a cluster.</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not matter whether that deployment is to a development, test, staging, or production environment. We need to deploy a new release to a cluster, even when that is a single-node Kubernetes running on a laptop. No matter how many environments we have, the process should always be the same or, at least, as similar as possible. We need to do all of this with zero-downtime. Deployments allow us to do that.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#what-is-it"></a></h3>
<p>A deployment is a higher-level abstraction that controlling and scaling a set of pods</p>
<ul>
<li>Behind the scenes, it uses a ReplicaSet to keep the Pods running, but it offers sophisticated logic for deploying, updating, and scaling a set of Pods within a cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.</p>
<ul>
<li>You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate</li>
</ul>
<p>The service in front of the deployment has an IP address, but this address only exists within the Kubernetes cluster. This means the service isn’t available to the Internet at all.</p>
<h3 id="zero-downtime-deployment">Zero-Downtime Deployment<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#zero-downtime-deployment"></a></h3>
<p>Deployments support rolling updates and rollbacks</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="/notes/kF916Ow84qpJJeMRkWMIo">Graphile-Migrate's</a> opinion about rolling forward only (ie. adding new migrations rather than removing them), we should follow this approach to deployments in Kubernetes (although the opinion is not as strong as Graphile-Migrate's).</p>
<ul>
<li>We definitely do not want to rollback (ie. <code>kubectl rollout undo</code>) in the situation where there is a database change, which would result in backend services that depend on a different version of the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>New deployments do not destroy ReplicaSets, but rather scale them to 0. Therefore, to undo a rollout all we need to do is scale the bad ReplicaSets to 0 and scale the good ReplicaSets to our desired number.</p>
<ul>
<li>This fact is reflected when we run <code>kubectl rollout history</code>. When we rollback, what we will see is that the associated command with the new revision will be the initial command that was used to create it (eg. <code>kubectl create --filename=deploy/go-demo-2-api.yml</code>). It might be natural to think that the command would be <code>kubectl set image</code>, but this is not the case.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Just as we are not supposed to create Pods directly but using other controllers like ReplicaSet, we are not supposed to create ReplicaSets either. Kubernetes Deployments will create them for us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, if we naively observe creating Pods via the 2 procedures, there is no difference:
<ul>
<li>Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> Pods</li>
<li>ReplicaSet -> Pods</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the advantage becomes evident if we try to change some of its aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. we might choose to upgrade MongoDB to version 3.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Deployment Controller is what creates the objects that are listed in the <code>deploy.yml</code> file. It watches the API server for new events, and creates the objects (eg. ReplicaSet) in response.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the ReplicaSet is created, the ReplicaSet Controller (which also watches for API events) notices that a new ReplicaSet was created, and in response, creates the Pods that it specified.</li>
<li>From there, the scheduler takes over, which watches for unassigned pods and assigns them to nodes.</li>
<li>Following that, Kubelet (which is watching for pods being assigned to nodes) causes the containers to be run (via Docker), then sends a signal to the API server indicating the updated status of the Pods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below, we tell the Deployment that it is to manage all the pods that have a label called <code>app</code> with the value <code>nginx</code></p>
<p>Example object spec for a Kubernetes Deployment:</p>
<pre class="language-yml"><code class="language-yml"><span class="token key atrule">apiVersion</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> apps/v1

This is the problem that Deployments solve.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desired state of our applications is changing all the time. The most common reasons for new states are new releases. The process is relatively simple. We make a change and commit it to a code repository. We build it, and we test it. Once we’re confident that it works as expected, we deploy it to a cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt does not matter whether that deployment is to a development, test, staging, or production environment. We need to deploy a new release to a cluster, even when that is a single-node Kubernetes running on a laptop. No matter how many environments we have, the process should always be the same or, at least, as similar as possible. We need to do all of this with zero-downtime. Deployments allow us to do that.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-it\"\u003eWhat is it?\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-is-it\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deployment is a higher-level abstraction that controlling and scaling a set of pods\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBehind the scenes, it uses a ReplicaSet to keep the Pods running, but it offers sophisticated logic for deploying, updating, and scaling a set of Pods within a cluster.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe service in front of the deployment has an IP address, but this address only exists within the Kubernetes cluster.

When we rollback, what we will see is that the associated command with the new revision will be the initial command that was used to create it (eg. \u003ccode\u003ekubectl create --filename=deploy/go-demo-2-api.yml\u003c/code\u003e).

ReplicaSet) in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnce the ReplicaSet is created, the ReplicaSet Controller (which also watches for API events) notices that a new ReplicaSet was created, and in response, creates the Pods that it specified.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom there, the scheduler takes over, which watches for unassigned pods and assigns them to nodes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFollowing that, Kubelet (which is watching for pods being assigned to nodes) causes the containers to be run (via Docker), then sends a signal to the API server

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"ZK0P0va9kOJGsM9X7X2Td"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
