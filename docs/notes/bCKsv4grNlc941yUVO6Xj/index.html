<p>The idea for SSR is that there is a large chunk of our website (if not all) that is static. It is expensive to ship a bundle of javascript to the client, and expect the client to do all the work of parsing it and converting it to html. The question becomes: "what if we could just pre-render this react into html beforehand on the server, and give that content to the client when it is requested? That way, the content can be served as fast as if we were using plain HTML/CSS/Javascript.</p>
<p>The most common use case for server-side rendering is to handle the initial render when a user (or search engine crawler) first requests our app. When the server receives the request, it renders the required component(s) into an HTML string, and then sends it as a response to the client. From that point on, the client takes over rendering duties.</p>
<h2 id="csr-vs-ssr">CSR vs SSR<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#csr-vs-ssr"></a></h2>
<h3 id="csr-approach">CSR Approach<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#csr-approach"></a></h3>
<p>Using CSR, the server will send a mostly empty HTML file to begin with. Through links, it will build up the page through a series of further HTTP requests.</p>
<ol>
<li>Browser requests <code>example.com/index.html</code></li>
<li>Server responds with <code>&#x3C;script/></code> tag at end of <code>&#x3C;body/></code></li>
<li>Browser makes an API request for the content in those script tags</li>
<li>Server responds with that content.</li>
<li>Browser makes async requests for Javascript bundles.
<ul>
<li>note: these bundles can be cached to speed things up in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons of CSR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading content may take a while because requests have to travel all the way to the server, which can be very far away.</li>
<li>SEO takes a hit because all search engines see is an empty HTML file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ssr-approach">SSR Approach<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ssr-approach"></a></h3>
<p>In SSR, the whole web page is compiled on the server. The HTML is completely populated with the content before it is sent to the client.</p>
<ol>
<li>Browser requests <code>example.com/index.html</code></li>
<li>Server makes co-located API requests to populate the HTML "template" with the data it needs</li>
<li>Server sends that populated HTML back to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons of SSR:</p>
<ul>
<li>A page will have to be rendered on the server and reloaded every time a new page on the site is visited, which will lead to full page reloads.</li>
<li>The server will receive frequent requests, which can easily lead to the server getting flooded with requests and slowing down.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="with-react">with React<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#with-react"></a></h3>
<p>With simple client-side rendering, we have a root node <code>&#x3C;div id="root"></code> to which the entire React app gets attached to. This node is by default empty.
With SSR, this node has some content by default. But, instead of replacing that content, we want React to attach a running application to it.</p>
<p>This is where hydration comes in. During hydration, React works quickly in a virtual DOM to match up the existing content with what the application renders, saving time from manipulating the DOM unnecessarily. It is this hydration that makes SSR worthwhile.</p>
<p>There are two big rules to hydrating an application in React.</p>
<ol>
<li>The initial render cycle of the application must result in the same markup, whether run on the client or the server.</li>
<li>We must call ReactDOM.hydrate instead of ReactDOM.render in order to instruct React to hydrate from our SSR result.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="with-redux">with Redux<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#with-redux"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When using Redux with server rendering, we must also send the state of our app along in our response, so the client can use it as the initial state. This is important because, if we preload any data before generating the HTML, we want the client to also have access to this data. Otherwise, the markup generated on the client won't match the server markup, and the client would have to load the data again.</li>
<li>To send the data down to the client, we need to:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>create a fresh, new Redux store instance on every request;</li>
<li>optionally dispatch some actions;</li>
<li>pull the state out of store;</li>
<li>and then pass the state along to the client.
Redux's only job on the server side is to provide the initial state of our app.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the server, you will want each request to have its own store, so that different users get different preloaded data.</p>

<p>Sometimes Gatsby is referred to as doing SSR. More realistic is that its doing SPG (Static site generation)</p>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"bCKsv4grNlc941yUVO6Xj"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
