<p>Replication in CouchDB works by comparing the source and the destination database to determine which documents differ between the source and the destination database. </p>
<ul>
<li>it follows the <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.2.0/api/database/changes.html#changes">Changes Feeds</a> on the source and compares the documents to the destination. Once it reaches the end of the feed, the replication process has finished.</li>
<li>we can set a replication to be <code>continuous</code>, meaning it will wait for new changes to appear until the task is canceled.</li>
<li>replications can also be paused with checkpoints, and continued. This is helpful is case of a fault.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes are then sent in batches to the destination, where they are compared and inform CouchDB if there are conflicts.</p>
<p>If you know Git, then you know how Couch replication works. Replicating is very similar to pushing or pulling with distributed source managers like Git.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Git, Couch documents have a linked-list revision history. If a revision exists in the other's history, then it can be fast-forwarded.</li>
<li>In Git, if 2 documents have a common ancestor, it's called a fork; in Couch, it's a conflict.
<ul>
<li>therefore neither Git or CouchDB have linear lists.</li>
<li>conflicts in CouchDB do not correspond to conflicts in Git
<ul>
<li>a conflict in CouchDB is a divergent revision history </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a child has multiple parents, Git allows us to merge. CouchDB can be configured to do this via the application code.
<ul>
<li>In Git, this is like copying and pasting the changes from branch A into branch B, then committing to branch B and deleting branch A. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a document is updated, it is given an incremented <code>_rev</code> value</p>
<ul>
<li>when an item is deleted (in CouchDB, soft deleted), its <code>_rev</code> value will be updated. Since it is considered as a new revision, when a document is deleted on the source, that deletion will be replicated to the target.</li>
</ul>
<p>Replication tasks can be initiated by either the sending node or the receiving node.</p>
<ul>
<li>when the sending node initiates the replication task, it is called <em>push replication</em></li>
<li>when the receiving node initiates the replication task, it is called <em>pull replication</em></li>
<li>Replication tasks only transfer changes in one direction.
<ul>
<li>the easiest way to perform a full sync is to do a "push" followed by a "pull" (or vice versa).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three options for controlling which documents are replicated, and which are skipped:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defining documents as being local.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.2.0/replication/replicator.html#selectorobj">Selector Objects</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>allows us to apply business logic through query expressions to determine whether or not a document should be included in the replication. The selector specifies fields in the document, and provides an expression to evaluate with the field content or other data. If the expression resolves to true, the document is replicated.</li>
<li>selector objects exist on a replication document.</li>
<li>note: selector objects are more performant than filter functions and should be preferred where possible (ie. when filtering on document attributes only).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Using <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.2.0/ddocs/ddocs.html#filterfun">Filter Functions</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>filter functions exist on a design document. They are special functions that are called whenever there is an entry in the Changes Feed that matches some criteria.
<ul>
<li>in principle they are like <a href="/notes/OSdV9FvBG3wDbRNLllg0V">lambdas</a> being triggered by some event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Replications are created by either Writing documents to the <code>_replicator</code> database (preferred) or POSTing to the <code>_replicate</code> HTTP endpoint (legacy) </p>
<p>The first database of CouchDB used <em>transient replication</em>. Transient means that there are no documents backing up the replicationâ€” after a restart of the CouchDB server, the replication will disappear.</p>
<ul>
<li>this still exists for backward compatability purposes</li>
<li>nowadays, <em>persistent replication</em> is used.
<ul>
<li>Persistent means the <code>_replicator</code> database is used, which keeps documents containing your replication parameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="replication-database">Replication database<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#replication-database"></a></h3>
<p>The <code>_replicator</code> database is like any other database in CouchDB, except for one feature: documents added to it will trigger replications</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a default <code>_replicator</code> database, but we can create our own.</li>
</ul>
<p>through the <code>_replicator</code> database, we can control the persistent replication</p>
<ul>
<li>each document describes one replication process</li>
</ul>
<p>Example document of <code>_replicator</code> database:</p>

<hr>
<p>CouchDB replication does not have its own protocol. A replicator simply connects to two DBs as a client, then reads from one and writes to the other. Push replication is reading the local data and updating the remote DB; pull replication is vice versa.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fun fact 1: The replicator is actually an independent Erlang application, in its own process. It connects to both couches, then reads records from one and writes them to the other.</li>
<li>Fun fact 2: CouchDB has no way of knowing who is a normal client and who is a replicator (let alone whether the replication is push or pull). It all looks like client connections. Some of them read records. Some of them write records.</li>
</ul>
<p>A record's revision ID is the checksum of its own data. Subsequent revision IDs are checksums of: the new data, plus the revision ID of the previous.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conflicts">Conflicts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conflicts"></a></h3>
<p>When putting a new version of a document, the source must provide the previous <code>_rev</code> value that it has. If the target does not have the same <code>_rev</code> value, then it will throw a 409 Conflict error.</p>
<p>When the update conflict occurs, the client who errored out must fetch again, and then either</p>
<ol>
<li>apply the same changes as were applied to the earlier revision, and submit a new PUT</li>
<li>redisplay the document so the user has to edit it again</li>
<li>just overwrite it with the document being saved before (which is not advisable, as user1â€™s changes will be silently lost)</li>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"6b96d1cy19ooewp49vo4x5d"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
