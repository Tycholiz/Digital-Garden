<p>Contract-based unit tests tell us if API endpoint connections are active and working properly.</p>
<p>With good contract tests in place, we should be reasonably assured that our code doesn't break upstream/downstream dependencies because of other teams unexpectedly changing their APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. a good reason to adopt contract tests would be if you had a service that served data to many different teams in your software organization. Say we had 5 different teams that consumed data from our interal API. It would be hard for us to know and keep track of which data each client expects. With contract tests, we can be kept aware of what each client needs, and know immediately if changes to our API will affect anyone who depends on it. This will save us in situations where say, we upgrade our API to v2 and break a few consumers (out of potentially dozens), because for instance the shape of the data changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good contract test for a deployed service gives us confidence that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API under test understands the request made of it</li>
<li>The API under test can send the response expected of it</li>
<li>The endpoints are accessible</li>
<li>The provider and the consumer have a working connection (assuming we are testing against a deployed service)</li>
<li>An expected integration is working</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole point of contract testing is to enable independent releases of components and <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">continuous delivery (Private)</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coupling this way prevents this and scales poorly as you add more teams and components.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#what-is-it"></a></h2>
<p>Contract testing is an alternative to e2e integrated testing.</p>
<p>Contract testing is a methodology for ensuring that two separate systems (such as two microservices) are compatible and are able to communicate with one other</p>
<ul>
<li>interactions exchanged between each service are captured, storing them in a contract, which can then be used to verify that both parties adhere to it.
<ul>
<li>to engage in contract testing is to interrogate a deployed (or mocked) service endpoint to get information back and compare to the expected values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>contract testing requires both parties to come to a consensus on the allowed set of interactions, and allowing for evolution over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between contract testing and other methods that aim to achieve the same thing is...</p>
<ul>
<li>each system is able to be tested independently from the other </li>
<li>the contract is generated by the code itself, meaning the contract is always kept up to date with reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contract testing is more relevant with a <a href="/notes/4JrFhUJpywlucgow6EX7j">microservice</a> architecture, given its distributed nature.</p>
<p>Contract tests exist to help with <a href="/notes/3MvwNqq5SfLk55OoIdqkH">integration testing</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a distributed system, integration testing is a process that helps us validate that the various moving parts that communicate remotely - things like microservices, web applications and mobile applications - all work together cohesively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-does-it-work"></a></h2>
<p>When writing contract tests, you have to ask yourself: am I the consumer or the provider?</p>
<ul>
<li>if consumer, then you need to look at only the endpoints you consume</li>
<li>if provider, then you need to look at <em>all</em> your endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>The contract must be available to all parties, which serves as our API documentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>The consumer (client) makes a request to a mock provider, and in turn receives a response. The request and response are both placed into a contract:
<pre><code>request: GET /users/123
response: 200 OK {"name": "Mary"}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>A simulated consumer (provided by a tool like Pact) then replays each request against the real provider and compares the actual and expected responses. If they match, we've verified that simulated applications should behave as real applications.

</ol>
<h3 id="consumerprovider">Consumer/Provider<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#consumerprovider"></a></h3>
<p>The consumer initiates the HTTP request.</p>
<p>The consumer side bargains to keep the <a href="/notes/965AqO8bdqbS0Et9bKsUO">mock</a> provider aligned with the contract, while the producer does everything to follow the contract.</p>
<ul>
<li>because of this, integration-like tests can be run without requiring the actual service provider to be available.</li>
</ul>
<p>For applications that use...</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP 
<ul>
<li>the consumer is always the application that initiates the HTTP request (eg. the web front end), regardless of the direction of data flow.</li>
<li>the provider is the application that returns the response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Queues 
<ul>
<li>the consumer is the application that reads the message from the queue.</li>
<li>the provider (also called producer) is the application that writes the messages to the queue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The provider is often called the <code>service</code></p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implementation"></a></h2>
<p>Pact tests exist as unit tests in the source code of the consumer.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. if we are testing an <code>OrderApiClient</code> class, whose responsibility is to make an http request, then this would be the unit to apply the contract test to.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the unit test, we set up a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/notes/965AqO8bdqbS0Et9bKsUO">mock</a> provider service, specifying a port at which it will run.
<ul>
<li>The mock service will respond to the client's queries over HTTP as if it were the real <code>OrderApi</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mock provider object, which allows us to set expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contract tests generally have the opposite properties to E2E-integrated tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>They run fast, because they don't need to talk to multiple systems.</li>
<li>They are are easier to maintain: you don't need to understand the entire ecosystem to write your tests.</li>
<li>They are easy to debug and fix, because the problem is only ever in the component you're testing - so you generally get a line number or a specific API endpoint that is failing.</li>
<li>They are repeatable</li>
<li>They scale. Because each component can be independently tested, build pipelines don't increase linearly / exponentially in time</li>
<li>They uncover bugs locally. Contract tests can and should run on developer machines prior to pushing code.</li>
<li>Contract testing keeps the API producers in sync with the consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detecting irregularities in a consumer workflow</li>
<li>Detecting any service configuration defects</li>
<li>Keeping the connections safe even when the producer changes any service configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>In contract testing for message queues, for the purpose of verifying a contract, the underlying message queue is mostly irrelevant. As long as you can ensure that the message producer is generating a correctly formatted message, and the consumer is able to consume it, you don’t need an actual message queue.</p>

<p>This means the consumer oversees contract creation. </p>
<p>Why would a consumer take charge of contract creation?</p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, consumers only care about a certain subset of data. They use a certain set of fields, they expect certain status codes etc. All of these details gets put into a contract that is then agreed to by the provider. Now, the provider has a good idea of what its consumers actually need, and now the provider can be free to develop its API without fear of breaking things for its consumer, since it now needs to make sure that it still satisfies the contracts laid out by the consumers.</li>

<p>Rarely used.</p>
<h2 id="testing-broker">Testing Broker<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#testing-broker"></a></h2>
<p>Once we have our contract tests in place, we need somewhere to put them. They don't do much good packaged alongside the repo whose code they are testing. Instead, we need it somewhere where it can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share and collaborate on contracts across teams</li>
<li>Manage contracts across code branches and environments</li>
<li>Orchestrate builds to know when it is safe to deploy</li>
<li>Integrate into your processes and tooling</li>
</ul>
<p>Pact Broker is an example of a testing broker, and it can be run both managed and self-hosted (e.g. as a <a href="/notes/a9w8WlKMHZZRdHc8EPBsD">Docker container</a>)</p>

This will save us in situations where say, we upgrade our API to v2 and break a few consumers (out of potentially dozens), because for instance the shape of the data changed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good contract test for a deployed service gives us confidence that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe API under test understands the request made of it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe API under test can send the response expected of it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe endpoints are accessible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe provider and the consumer have a working connection (assuming we are testing against a deployed service)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn expected integration is working\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole point of contract testing is to enable independent releases of components and \u003ca title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\"\u003econtinuous delivery (Private)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCoupling this way prevents this and scales poorly as you add more teams and components.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-it\"\u003eWhat is it?\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-is-it\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContract testing is an alternative to e2e integrated testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContract testing is a methodology for ensuring that two separate systems (such as two microservices) are compatible and are able to communicate with one other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003einteractions exchanged between each service are captured, storing them in a contract, which can then be used to verify that both parties adhere to it.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eto engage in contract testing is to interrogate a deployed (or mocked) service endpoint to get information back and compare to the expected values.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econtract testing requires both parties to come to a consensus on the allowed set of interactions, and allowing for evolution over time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference between contract testing and other methods that aim to achieve the same thing is...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eeach system is able to be tested independently from the other \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe contract is generated by the code itself, meaning the contract is always kept up to date with reality.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContract testing is more relevant with a \u003ca href=\"/notes/4JrFhUJpywlucgow6EX7j\"\u003emicroservice\u003c/a\u003e architecture, given its distributed nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContract tests exist to help with \u003ca href=\"/notes/3MvwNqq5SfLk55OoIdqkH\"\u003eintegration testing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn a distributed system, integration testing is a process that helps us validate that the various moving parts that communicate remotely - things like microservices, web applications and mobile applications - all work together cohesively.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-does-it-work\"\u003eHow does it work?\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-does-it-work\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen writing contract tests, you have to ask yourself: am I the consumer or the provider?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eif consumer, then you need to look at only the endpoints you consume\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eif provider, then you need to look at \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e your endpoints\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe contract must be available to all parties, which serves as our API documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe consumer (client) makes a request to a mock provider, and in turn receives a response.

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"NfY3pvmOMzpQg8TKrUMGd"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
