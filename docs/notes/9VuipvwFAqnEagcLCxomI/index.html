<ol>
<li>When <code>www.facebook.com</code> is searched, the browser DNS cache is checked to see if the domain and IP address key-value pair is stored, after that, the OS's cache, then the DNS server configured on the system (which might be the DNS server in the home router, the ISP (Internet Service Provider), or the public DNS server.)</li>
<li>after the browser cache is checked, the resolver intercepts the request and checks its own cache. </li>
<li>If it doesn't have anything, it will make a request to the root server to see if it has it cached. 
<ul>
<li>the part of the URL corresponding to root server is the final <code>.</code> of <code>www.facebook.com.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If it does not, then it proceeds down the chain until the authoritative nameserver. 
<ul>
<li>the next parts of the chain are <code>com</code>, then <code>facebook</code>, then <code>www</code>. each of these is essentially a zone</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At any point, if the nameserver does indeed have the website cached, then it will return it to the resolver, who will proceed to return it to the client in domain form. </p>
<h2 id="dns-request">DNS Request<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dns-request"></a></h2>
<p>A DNS request is executed by the browser on a device. The first thing the OS checks is the hosts file. If the hosts file has an entry for the DNS, then this entry is always used, regardless of what comes next.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the hosts file turns up no result, then the network card settings will be queried. This can come from one of 2 places:
<pre><code>1. IP addresses of DNS servers configured in router
2. IP addresses of DNS servers configured on device itself (in which the DNS settings on router would be set to *manual*)
</code></pre>
When the DNS resolves, the browser is enabled to connect to a web server or a CDN edge server </li>
</ul>
<p>DNS queries and responses are sent in plaintext (via UDP), which means they can be read by networks, ISPs, or anybody able to monitor transmissions (even when using HTTPS)</p>
<!-- During a new DNS lookup, the lookup passes through the resolver, root server, and TLD server. -->
<p>At each step of the DNS lookup, information is gathered and cached for later use</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, in a DNS lookup, the resolution process runs until either it reaches the DNS server (?) and gets the IP, or one of the stages returns a cached version of the website. </li>
</ul>
<p>DNS Lookup:
<img src="/assets/images/2021-08-01-21-31-10.png" alt="DNS lookup"></p>
<p><em>Below may be roughly the same info as above, but it's a good resource. combine the 2 snippets when we have more time</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>A DNS request starts when you try to access a computer on the internet. For example, you type <a href="http://www.varonis.com">www.varonis.com</a> in your browser address bar.</li>
<li>The first stop for the DNS request is the local DNS cache. As you access different computers, those IP addresses get stored in a local repository.  If you visited <a href="http://www.varonis.com">www.varonis.com</a> before, you have the IP address in your cache.</li>
<li>If you don’t have the IP address in your local DNS cache, DNS will check with a recursive DNS server. Your IT team or Internet Service Provider (ISP) usually provides a recursive DNS server for this purpose.</li>
<li>The recursive DNS server has its own cache, and if it has the IP address, it will return it to you. If not, it will go ask another DNS server.</li>
<li>The next stop is the TLD name servers, in this case, the TLD name server for the .com addresses. These servers don’t have the IP address we need, but it can send the DNS request in the right direction.</li>
<li>What the TLD name servers do have is the location of the authoritative name server for the requested site. The authoritative name server responds with the IP address for <a href="http://www.varonis.com">www.varonis.com</a> and the recursive DNS server stores it in the local DNS cache and returns the address to your computer.</li>
<li>Your local DNS service  gets the IP address and connects to <a href="http://www.varonis.com">www.varonis.com</a> to download all the glorious content. DNS then records the IP address in local cache with a time-to-live (TTL) value. The TTL is the amount of time the local DNS record is valid, and after that time, DNS will go through the process again when you request Varonis.com the next time.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reverse-dns-lookup">Reverse DNS Lookup<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#reverse-dns-lookup"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Forward DNS lookup</em> is using an Internet domain name to find an IP address. <em>Reverse DNS lookup</em> is using an Internet IP address to find a domain name
<ul>
<li>when you put a URL in the address bar, the address is transmitted to a nearby router which does a forward DNS lookup in a routing table to locate the IP address</li>
<li><code>PTR Record</code> is a <a href="/notes/TALpAZmsruqyoUkJzegVv">RR</a> for enabling reverse DNS lookups, which is the exact opposite of an A record.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverse lookups are commonly used by email servers, who check and see if an email message came from a valid server before bringing it onto their network.
<ul>
<li>Many email servers will reject messages from any server that does not support reverse lookups (the absense of a <code>PTR record</code> means reverse lookups aren't supported)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-in-addrarpa-domain">The <code>in-addr.arpa</code> domain<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-in-addrarpa-domain"></a></h3>
<p>When an IP address is resolved from a domain name, a subdomain of the <code>in-addr.arpa</code> domain is created.</p>
<ul>
<li>each subdomain value of this domain corresponds to the IP address of the resolved domain we searched for, though in reverse order</li>
<li>ex. if the IP address of <code>blog.example.com</code> is <code>15.16.192.152</code>, then the corresponding node in the <code>in-addr.arpa</code> domain is <code>152.192.16.15.in-addr.arpa</code>, which maps back to our domain name <code>blog.example.com</code>
<ul>
<li>the <code>15.in-addr.arpa</code> zone contains the reverse-mapping information for all hosts whose IP addresses start with <code>15</code>.</li>
</ul>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"9VuipvwFAqnEagcLCxomI"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
