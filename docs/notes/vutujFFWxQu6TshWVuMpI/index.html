<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#what-is-it"></a></h2>
<p>A distributed system is a system whose components are spread across many machines on a single <a href="/notes/XhvCDW3fIw6h6MhY5ticq">network</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>this network can be anything from a local network to the internet, in cases where we want geographic distribution. </li>
</ul>
<p>In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers, which communicate with each other via <a href="/notes/Skg9BUUhw2xIBmwrkEP4u">message passing</a>.</p>
<p>Data partition and replication strategies lie at the core of any distributed system.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/gKVIPNGV7duiD0yRnld8J">Replication</a> - Keeping a copy of the same data on several different nodes, potentially in different locations. 
<ul>
<li>provides redundancy and improves performance (giving us more nodes to read from).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/FuHcb7zDdczt8IDTtOH0b">Partitioning</a> - Splitting a big database into smaller subsets (partitions) so each can be assigned to different nodes 
<ul>
<li>ex. <a href="/notes/nMxAwbzkQChlhX37Gih8a">sharding</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="/notes/g2jDjW3rfwpjkoQXFUDaY">client-server architecture</a> might be thought of as the simplest implementation of a distributed system.</p>
<p>A distributed system is not to be confused with <a href="/notes/kT9Y4OEW9TlDwChB6a5PT">decentralized architecture</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed means that the processing is shared across multiple nodes, but the decisions may still be centralized and use complete system knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed systems typically have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/W5etsXYnFDHBWHEHSZKjp">concurrency</a> of components</li>
<li>lack of a global clock</li>
<li>failure of components</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="from-a-single-computer-to-a-distributed-network">From a Single computer to a distributed network<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#from-a-single-computer-to-a-distributed-network"></a></h3>
<p>With a single computer, when the hardware is working correctly, the same operation always produces the same result (it is deterministic). If there is a hardware problem, the result is normally a total system failure. Alas, an individual computer with properly functional software is either fully functional or entirely broken (this is deliberate, so as to simplify troubleshooting).</p>
<p>In a distributed system, some computers may be broken in some unpredictable way while others are working fine. This is known as <em>partial failure</em>, and they add considerable difficulty because they are a class of failure that is <em>nondeterministic</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes we may not even know if something failed or succeeded, since the time it takes for a message to travel across a network is also nondeterministic. If you send a request and don’t get a response, it’s not possible to distinguish whether (a) the request was lost, (b) the remote node is down, or (c) the response was lost.
<ul>
<li>this can be summed up as <em>"problems in the network cannot reliably be distinguished from problems at a node"</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>this nondeterminism and possibility of partial failure is what adds difficulty to distributed systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a distributed system is about building a reliable system from unreliable components.</p>
<ul>
<li>anal: <a href="/notes/d2e2hSjyVoKd0AmH4P1Yj">TCP</a> is a relible protocol built on the unreliable <a href="/notes/0w98vh6pnzlzjxe4rd4808x">IP</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="consensus">Consensus<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#consensus"></a></h4>
<p>The difficulty involved in reaching consensus amongst all areas of a distributed system is one of the most important and fundamental problems of architecting a distributed system. </p>
<p>The consensus problem is normally formalized as follows: one or more nodes may propose values, and the consensus algorithm decides on one of those values. Everyone decides on the same outcome, and once you have decided, you cannot change your mind. </p>
<ul>
<li>In an example of seat-booking of an airplane, when several customers are concurrently trying to buy the last seat, each node handling a customer request may propose the ID of the customer it is serving, and the decision indicates which one of those customers got the seat.</li>
</ul>
<p>a consensus algorithm must satisfy the following properties </p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform agreement - No two nodes decide differently.</li>
<li>Integrity - No node decides twice.</li>
<li>Validity - If a node decides value v, then v was proposed by some node.</li>
<li>Termination - Every node that does not crash eventually decides some value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consensus much be achieved for...</p>
<ul>
<li><em>leader election</em>. In a database with single-leader replication, all nodes must agree on which node is the leader.</li>
<li><em>atomic commits</em>. In a database that supports transactions spanning several nodes/partitions, we have the possibility of a transaction failing on some nodes but succeeding on others. If we want to maintain transaction <a href="/notes/iVqY5tKOzlWVVRzOqOED5">atomicity</a>, we must have all nodes in agreement about the outcome of a transaction (either they all abort+rollback or commit).</li>
</ul>
<p>Zookeeper and <a href="/notes/btan6P1szAXOhnBlAKUDR">etcd</a> provide consensus algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-it">Why do it?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-do-it"></a></h2>
<p>Key characteristics of a distributed system include Scalability, Reliability, Availability, Efficiency, and Manageability.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-does-it-work"></a></h2>
<p>Messages may be passed between nodes of a distributed system by using technologies like HTTP, <a href="/notes/GHjKTmxGjjtoWBzfz9MZL">RPCs</a>, or <a href="/notes/Skg9BUUhw2xIBmwrkEP4u">message queues</a></p>
<p>Historically, <em>distributed</em> referred to the fact that there were multiple computers all working in unison to solve some problem. Nowadays, the term is much broader, and can be used to refer to a system of multiple autonomous processes existing on a single machine. In this case, a node of the "network" would be a single process, rather than an entire computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of distributed computing, a node is simply something that passes messages and has its own local memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no clear distinction between distributed systems and parallel systems, and there is a lot of overlap, thought one distinction is that the nodes of a parallel system all share the same memory, while nodes of a distributed system manage their own:

<h2 id="considerations-for-distributed-systems">Considerations for distributed systems<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#considerations-for-distributed-systems"></a></h2>
<p>According to <a href="/notes/ilOPfgNyiPSHOb9tNB6yL">CAP theorem</a>, out of consistency, availability and partition tolerance, you can only really achieve 2/3.</p>
<h3 id="problems-specific-to-distributed-systems">Problems specific to distributed systems<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#problems-specific-to-distributed-systems"></a></h3>
<p>The typical problems in a distributed system are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintaining the system state (liveness of nodes)</li>
<li>communication between nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>The potential solutions to these problems are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>centralized state management service (eg <a href="/notes/zxt3lhonfdhglvijd17ua8c">Zookeeper</a>, <a href="/notes/btan6P1szAXOhnBlAKUDR">etcd</a>)
<ul>
<li>A centralized state management service such as Apache Zookeeper can be configured as the service discovery to keep track of the state of every node in the system</li>
<li>provides a strong consistency guarantee, the primary drawbacks are the state management service becomes a single point of failure and runs into scalability problems for a large distributed system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>peer-to-peer state management service
<ul>
<li>The peer-to-peer state management approach is inclined towards high availability and eventual consistency. The gossip protocol algorithms can be used to implement peer-to-peer state management services with high scalability and improved resilience 1.</li>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"vutujFFWxQu6TshWVuMpI"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
