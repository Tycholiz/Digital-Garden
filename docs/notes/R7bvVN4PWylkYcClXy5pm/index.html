<p>When doing an inner join, if either table is unmatched by the other, then those rows will be excluded from the result set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Outer joins allow us to select rows from one table that may or may not have the corresponding rows in other tables.
<ul>
<li>a LEFT JOIN returns only the unmatched rows from the left table (the original table we are joining onto)
<ul>
<li>"get me all rows from the left table, even if there are no matching rows in the right table"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a RIGHT JOIN returns only the unmatched rows from the right table (the new table we are adding)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Making a LEFT JOIN and then putting a column from the outer table in the WHERE clause would give us an error, (spec): since that column would be unselectable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-songs-and-artists">Example: songs and artists<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-songs-and-artists"></a></h3>
<p>Imagine we have songs and artists. Each song has 0 or more artists. This is possible because a song might not have an attributed author.</p>
<p>Imagine we query the songs table, then left join artists. This would allow us a result set that includes all the songs without artist. If we had done an inner join, then the songs without an artist would not have ended up in the result set</p>
<h2 id="left-outer-join">Left Outer Join<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#left-outer-join"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>called <em>left outer</em> because the table on the left of the join operator will have each of its rows in the output at least once, whereas the table on the right will only have those rows output that match some row of the left table.
<ul>
<li>if there is not right-table match, a null value will be substituted in for right-table columns.</li>
<li>a common way to distinguish the left and right side of the join is to use aliases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Left join semantics are to keep the whole result set of the table lexically on the left of the operator, and to fill-in the columns for the table on the right of the left join operator when some data is found that matches the join condition, otherwise using NULL as the columnâ€™s value.</li>
<li>there are times when we do want to include data where there isn't a match (ex. there is no matching FK for a given PK between 2 tables of a corresponding row). In these cases, we have to use an OUTER JOIN.
<ul>
<li>ex. we are doing a left join on "bucket", and we have buckets in our db that have no nuggets. this would result in a <code>null</code> value for the "nugget" column associated with that row.
<img src="/:/2af5c67cf5fb4b898d5323ce1cb0849b" alt="2890a1430af9f888455d50224e795554.png"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's the LEFT or RIGHT keyword that makes the JOIN an "OUTER" JOIN
<ul>
<li>ie, all JOINs designated either LEFT or RIGHT are by definition OUTER JOINs</li>
<li>We use LEFT, RIGHT or FULL to specify which table should have all of its rows returned, regardless of the condition being met.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the first table is the "left" table</li>
<li>best practice is to avoid Right Outer Joins</li>
<li>when joining tables, all rows inclded in the left table will show up on the new table, even if one of the cells is missing, as in prev. example.</li>
<li>the left outer join starts selecting data from the left table. it compares the 2 values (specified after <code>ON</code>).
<ul>
<li>If they are equal, a new row is created that contains columns of both tables and adds the new row to the result set</li>
<li>if they are not equal, a new row is still created, but the right table's columns will be filled with <code>null</code></li>
<li>If we want, we can add a WHERE clause to this query to only return rows from the left table that do not having matching rows in the right table
<ul>
<li>this effectively cuts out the intersection from the venn diagram</li>
<li>ex. <code>...WHERE tableb_col IS NULL;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if we made a venn diagram of table1 and table2, an outer join would give us the outer parts of the venn diagram Union.
<ul>
<li>we will get all of the rows of the left table, but only the "rows in common" that the right table has
<ul>
<li>ex. if the left table has <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, those will always show up no matter what. If the right table has <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, then only <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> will show up (the rest will be null)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Venn diagram illustrates the left join that returns rows from the left table that do not have matching rows from the right table:
<img src="/:/69d6642385194490a8d62f93f8cf1bdb" alt="6457179c137a03db0dd9765c9cd6c988.png"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="full-outer-join">Full Outer Join<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#full-outer-join"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>returns a result set that contains all rows from both left and right tables, with the matching rows from both sides if available.
<ul>
<li>In case there is no match, the columns of the table will be filled with NULL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>similar to the above techniques using <code>WHERE</code> clause to cut out the intersection, we can do the same here
<pre><code>- This would give us the rows from one table that do not have the corresponding rows in another table
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine we have <code>paymnent_sources</code>, which has a <code>payment_method_id</code> column, and both <code>coupons</code> and <code>credit_cards</code> has also have a <code>payment_method_id</code> column. In other words, a payment_source can reference either a credit_card or a coupon. Let's say we want to query all payment_sources, including all credit_cards and coupons. We would <code>select from payment_sources</code>, then <code>left outer join</code> the credit_cards table and the coupons table. Therefore, <code>left join</code> is the concept of "I have a baseline group of records, and I want to get all attachments to that baseline, without caring about how each attachment relates to other attachements (e.g. credit_cards to coupons)</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#example-songs-and-artists" title="Example: songs and artists">Example: songs and artists</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#left-outer-join" title="Left Outer Join">Left Outer Join</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#full-outer-join" title="Full Outer Join">Full Outer Join</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#left-vs-right-join" title="Left vs Right Join">Left vs Right Join</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></main></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"R7bvVN4PWylkYcClXy5pm","title":"Outer Join","desc":"","updated":1645767080084,"created":1615337798887,"custom":{},"fname":"sql.join.outer","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"},"contentHash":"22f91e1af08d79f881d843815a7d68dc","links":[],"anchors":{"example-songs-and-artists":{"type":"header","text":"Example: songs and artists","value":"example-songs-and-artists","line":15,"column":0,"depth":3},"left-outer-join":{"type":"header","text":"Left Outer Join","value":"left-outer-join","line":20,"column":0,"depth":2},"full-outer-join":{"type":"header","text":"Full Outer Join","value":"full-outer-join","line":46,"column":0,"depth":2},"left-vs-right-join":{"type":"header","text":"Left vs Right Join","value":"left-vs-right-join","line":53,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":[],"parent":"74d0c3a8-73ff-4964-bc57-7ceb6f8b8cb5","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"outer-join\"\u003eOuter Join\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#outer-join\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen doing an inner join, if either table is unmatched by the other, then those rows will be excluded from the result set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOuter joins allow us to select rows from one table that may or may not have the corresponding rows in other tables.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea LEFT JOIN returns only the unmatched rows from the left table (the original table we are joining onto)\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\"get me all rows from the left table, even if there are no matching rows in the right table\"\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea RIGHT JOIN returns only the unmatched rows from the right table (the new table we are adding)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMaking a LEFT JOIN and then putting a column from the outer table in the WHERE clause would give us an error, (spec): since that column would be unselectable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"example-songs-and-artists\"\u003eExample: songs and artists\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#example-songs-and-artists\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine we have songs and artists.

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"R7bvVN4PWylkYcClXy5pm"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
