<p>Unlike Android, you can't install any app on an iOS device. It has to be signed by Apple first.</p>
<h2 id="test-deploy">Test Deploy<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#test-deploy"></a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to distribute a test version of your app for iOS: TestFlight and Ad Hoc.</p>
<ul>
<li>TestFlight involves submitting a build to App Store Connect where it can be downloaded by other users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="app-signing">App signing<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#app-signing"></a></h2>
<p>Signing your app allows the iOS system to identify who signed your app and to verify that your app hasn't been modified since you signed it. </p>
<ul>
<li>before an app can be installed on a device (or even submitted to the App Store), the developer must sign the <code>.ipa</code> executable (code signing) by using the certificate (spec: the <code>.p12</code> file) procured from Apple's developer portal.
<ul>
<li>when an app is signed with a certificate, Apple can be reasonably assured that the signer is also the person whom the certificate was issued to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Signing Identity consists of a <a href="/notes/bO8xztJCzUxsN2sM4YsBE">public-private</a> key pair that Apple creates for you.
<ul>
<li>remember, certificate is another name for public key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) through the Keychain Access application.</li>
<li>Keychain Access will create a private key (to be stored in the keychain) and a <code>certSigningRequest</code> file which you'll then upload through Apple's web portal.</li>
<li>Apple will proof the request and issue a certificate for you. The Certificate will contain the public key that can be downloaded to your system. After you downloaded it you need to put it into Keychain Access by double clicking it. The Certificate will be pushed into the Keychain and paired with the private key to form the Code Signing Identity.</li>
<li>Finally, as the app is being installed on the device, the private key used to sign the app matches the public key in the certificate. If it fails, app is not installed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terms">Terms<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#terms"></a></h2>
<h3 id="provisioning-profile-or-simply-profile">Provisioning profile (or simply Profile)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#provisioning-profile-or-simply-profile"></a></h3>
<p>The provisioning profile acts as a link between the device and the developer account. </p>
<ul>
<li>therefore the certificate and the device are the 2 main parts of the provisioning profile.
<ul>
<li>getting a certificate involves going to the Apple portal to get a development certificate, which involes registering your device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Distribution Profiles are used to submit an app to the App Store for distribution. After the app is reviewed by apple they sign in the app with their own signature that can run on any device.</p>
<p>We use the profile for testing our app prior to sending it to Apple for approval.</p>
<p>A provisioning profile is downloaded from your developer account on Apple's web portal and embedded in the app bundle, and the entire bundle is code-signed.</p>
<p>A Development Provisioning Profile must be installed on each device on which you wish to run your application code.</p>
<ul>
<li>once made, we can download it, then drag it onto the Xcode icon of the MacOS Dock</li>
<li>doing this will create a <code>mobileprovision</code> file in <code>~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles</code>. The filename takes the form <code>&#x3C;ProfileUUID>.mobileprovision</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We must generate provisioning profiles in the <code>developer.apple.com</code> portal.</p>
<p>Provisioning profiles are not stored with the project. Xcode has a common area and the profile is pulled when you build and bundled with the <code>ipa</code> (the binary file of your app).</p>
<p>Each provisioning profile contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development Certificates — development certificate. These are for developers who want to test the app on a physical device while writing code.</li>
<li>Unique Device Identifiers (List of devices that the app can run on)</li>
<li>an App ID — An App ID is a two-part string used to identify one or more apps from a single development team.
<ul>
<li>this can include a <code>*</code> wild card to be used for many applications with similar bundle identifiers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you install the application on a device the following things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>the provisioning profile in the Mac goes to the developer certificate in your key chain.</li>
<li>xcode uses the certificate to sign the code.</li>
<li>device's UUID is matched with the IDs in the provisioning profile.</li>
<li>AppID in the provisioning profile is matched with the bundle identifier in the app.</li>
<li>The entitlements required are associated with the App ID.</li>
<li>The private key used to sign the app matches the public key in the certificate.</li>
<li>the signed binary is sent to the device and is validated against the same provisioning profile in the app and finally launches.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-25-09-15-11.png"></p>
<p>In simple terms, Provisioning profiles say, “applications with this Identifier signed with this Certificate’s private key are okay to run on these devices.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore a provisioning profile is tied to a certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>An App ID is a two-part string used to identify one or more apps from a single development team. The string consists of a Team ID and a bundle ID search string, with a period (.) separating the two parts. The Team ID is supplied by Apple and is unique to a specific development team, while
The bundle ID search string is supplied by the developer to match either the bundle ID of a single app or a set of bundle IDs for a group of apps.</p>
<p>The bundle ID uniquely defines each App. It is specified in Xcode. A single Xcode project can have multiple Targets and therefore output multiple apps. A common use case for this is an app that has both lite/free and pro/full versions or is branded multiple ways.</p>
<p>spec: is provisioning profile a private key?</p>
<h3 id="archive">Archive<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#archive"></a></h3>
<p>An archive is a bundle that includes your app binary along with symbol information. </p>
<ul>
<li>Archive is the format our app is in when we distribute it for testing or validate and submit it to App Store Connect.
<ul>
<li>in other words, to upload our app to App Store, we must first archive it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The archive contains debugging information.</p>
<ul>
<li>While testing the app through TestFlight, keep the archive with the debugging information to make it easier to interpret crash reports later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Archives for each version of our app should be saved.</p>
<p>Using Archives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Archives can be found in <em>Window > Organizer</em></li>
<li>Archives can be made in <em>Product > Archive</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="symbolication">Symbolication<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#symbolication"></a></h3>
<p>Symbolication deals with translating how a computer sees code at runtime (that is, machine code dealing with low-level processes) and how we as developers see code.</p>
<ul>
<li>without symbolication, we would be reading machine code debug logs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asset-catalog">Asset Catalog<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#asset-catalog"></a></h3>
<p>Asset catalogs simplify access to app resources by mapping between named assets and one or more files targeted for different device attributes.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. depending on whether the user is using an iPad or iPhone, we want to serve up different versions of each Asset. It is a waste to download iPhone 12 optimized images for an iPad user of our app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Asset Catalog is found in a <code>Assets.xcassets</code> or <code>Images.xcassets</code> directory</p>
<p>Contents.json files encode the attributes for elements represented by folders in the hierarchy. Each folder can contain one Contents.json file that encodes the attributes for the asset or group it contains.</p>
<p>spec: Android parallel: Drawable Folder</p>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*.
