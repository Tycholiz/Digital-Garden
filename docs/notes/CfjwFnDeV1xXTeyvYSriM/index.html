<p>A pointer is a variable that stores both a memory address and the type of data that resides at that memory location.</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining the value stored at that location is known as <em>dereferencing the pointer</em>
<ul>
<li>anal: The index within a textbook has page numbers which reference pages in the book. Dereferencing the pointer would be done by flipping to that page and reading the text.</li>
<li>the type of the pointer tells the compiler what operations can be performed through that pointer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a pointer is a very thin abstraction built on top of a language's own addressing capabilities</li>
<li>Each unit of memory in a system is assigned a unique address (memory location).
<ul>
<li>A pointer is an object that stores this address.
<ul>
<li>This is similar in concept to how we dont store images in a database, we just store its url location</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conceptually, the fact that memory is just stored in blocks makes memory itself a very large array.</li>
<li>arrays work a bit differently in that the variable points to the address (location) of the first character in the array </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pointers are used partly because they are sometimes the only way to express a computation, and partly because they usually lead to more compact and efficient code than can be obtained in other ways
<ul>
<li>They are especially efficient when used in repetitive operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pointers are used for constructing <em>references</em>, which in turn are fundamental to constructing nearly all data structures</li>
<li>using a pointer to retrieve the value that is stored at the relevant memory location is called <strong>dereferencing the pointer</strong></li>
<li>anal:if storage were a reference book, then the page number in the index would be the pointer, and flipping to that page and reading the text would be dereferencing that pointer.</li>
<li>the format of a pointer is dependent on the underlying computer architecture (since pointer's pertain to physical memory locations)</li>
<li>Pointers and arrays are closely related
<ul>
<li>Any operation that can be achieved by array subscripting can also be done with pointers</li>
<li>consider that when we declare an array <code>x</code> of length 10, we are reserving 10 contiguous memory cells. We can create a pointer that points to the first element with <code>ptr = &#x26;x[0];</code>. Now, we can copy the contents of that first element to <code>y</code> with <code>y = *ptr;</code>.
<ul>
<li>Since elements in an array are contiguous, by defintion <code>ptr+1</code> points to the second element in the array, and <code>*(ptr+1)</code> refers to the <em>contents</em> of <code>x[1]</code> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ex. a char occupies a single byte, a short occupies 2 contiguous bytes, a long occupies 4 contiguous bytes, and so on.
<ul>
<li>Naturally, this means that contiguous groups of memory cells can be manipulated</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A pointer is a group of cells (often two or four) that can hold an address</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example">Example<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example"></a></h3>
<p>Imagine we executed the following code:</p>
<pre><code>int a = 5;
int *ptr = NULL;
</code></pre>
<p>assuming that <code>a</code> is stored at <code>0x8130</code> and <code>ptr</code> at <code>0x8134</code>, our memory would look like:
| Address | Value |
|---------|------------|
| 0x8130  | 0x00000005 |
| 0x8134  | 0x00000000 |</p>
<p>now this code is run:</p>
<pre><code>ptr = &#x26;a;
</code></pre>
<p>And our memory looks like this:
| Address | Value |
|---------|------------|
| 0x8130  | 0x00000005 |
| 0x8134  | 0x00008130 |</p>
<p>now we can dereference <code>ptr</code>:</p>
<pre><code>*ptr = 8;
</code></pre>
<p>And our computer takes the contents of <code>ptr</code> (0x00008130), locates the address, and assigns 8 to that location, yielding this memory:
| Address | Value |
|---------|------------|
| 0x8130  | 0x00000008 |
| 0x8134  | 0x00008130 |</p>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"CfjwFnDeV1xXTeyvYSriM"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
