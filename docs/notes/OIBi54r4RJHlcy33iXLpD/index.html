<h1 id="overview">Overview<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#overview"></a></h1>
<p>Dependency Injection is one form of implementing <a href="/notes/bXY3W37GW2ytFJOgbJiol">Inversion of Control</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Here, IoC would be achieved by delegating instantiation of dependencies to the IoC container
<ul>
<li>ex. in <a href="/notes/613syb18hb3v0u1ydvor7ru">Nestjs</a>, the IoC container is the Nestjs runtime system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependency Injection also naturally flows out of the principle of Modularity</p>
<h3 id="goal">Goal<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#goal"></a></h3>
<p>The goal is to achieve <a href="/notes/rJCjWKYnnHAyCCtIwZ8kj">separation of concerns</a></p>
<p>The client should have no concrete knowledge of the specific implementation of its dependencies. It should only know the interface's name and API. As a result, the client will not need to change even if what is behind the interface changes. Because we achieve this by using interfaces, if the interface itself changes, then the client will have to change as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. if the interface is refactored from being a class to an interface type (or vice versa) the client will need to be reworked.</li>
<li>This last point creates a potential issue if the client and services are published separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having more testable code is a big benefit of using dependency injection</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#motivation"></a></h3>
<p>Dependency injection separates the creation of a client's dependencies from the client's behavior, which allows program designs to be loosely coupled and to follow the dependency inversion and single responsibility principles.</p>
<p>A client who wants to call some services should not have to know how to construct those services. Instead, the client delegates the responsibility of providing its services to external code (the injector; see below)</p>
<ul>
<li>The client is not allowed to call the injector code; it is the injector that constructs the services</li>
</ul>
<p>The injector then injects (passes) the services into the client which might already exist or may also be constructed by the injector. The client then uses the services. This means the client does not need to know about the injector, how to construct the services, or even which actual services it is using. The client only needs to know about the intrinsic interfaces of the services because these define how the client may use the services. This separates the responsibility of "use" from the responsibility of "construction".</p>
<h4 id="dependency-inversion-principle">Dependency Inversion Principle<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dependency-inversion-principle"></a></h4>
<p>This principle states two essential things:</p>
<ol>
<li>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</li>
<li>Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on abstractions.</li>
</ol>
<p>DIP keeps high-level modules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up. It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces the coupling between modules.</p>
<h3 id="components">Components<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#components"></a></h3>
<p>Dependency injection involves four roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>the service object(s) to be used</li>
<li>the client object that is depending on the service(s) it uses</li>
<li>the interfaces that define how the client may use the services</li>
<li>the injector, which is responsible for constructing the services and injecting them into the client
<ul>
<li>The injector may be referred to by other names such as: assembler, provider, container, factory, builder, spring, construction code, or main</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As an analogy,</p>
<ol>
<li><code>service</code> - an electric, gas, hybrid, or diesel car</li>
<li><code>client</code> - a driver who uses the car the same way regardless of the engine</li>
<li><code>interface</code> - automatic, ensures driver does not have to understand details of shifting gears</li>
<li><code>injector</code> - the parent who bought the car for the driver and decided which kind</li>
</ol>
<p>Any object that may be used can be considered a service. Any object that uses other objects can be considered a client. The names have nothing to do with what the objects are for and everything to do with the role the objects play in any one injection.</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros-and-cons"></a></h2>
<h3 id="pros">Pros<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The client becomes an entity whose behavior is fixed, yet configurable. The client may act on anything that supports the intrinsic interface the client expects</li>
<li>Because clients are more independent, they are easier to unit test. They are more like proper modules, that we can test in isolation, using stubs and mocks to simulate that module interacting with other modules.</li>
<li>DI can be an effective way to refactor legacy code, because it does not require any change in code behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="explanation-of-terminology">Explanation of terminology<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#explanation-of-terminology"></a></h3>
<p>An "Injection" is the basic unit of dependency injection, and it works in the same way that "parameter passing" works</p>
<ul>
<li>Referring to "parameter passing" as an injection carries the added implication that it is being done to isolate the client from details</li>
<li>An injection doesn't care about how the passing is accomplished. For instance, it doesn't care if it is passed by value or by reference.</li>
<li>An injection is about what is in control of the passing (never the client)</li>
</ul>
<p>The DI pattern involves an object receiving other objects that it depends on.</p>
<ul>
<li>These "other objects" are called dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the client-server relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here, the client is the object that receives, and the server is the object that is passed (ie. "injected")</li>
<li>The code that passes the service to the client is called the <em>Injector</em>.</li>
<li>Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use. The "injection" refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the object (a client) that would use it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Examples<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#examples"></a></h2>
<h3 id="desktoplaptop-analogy">Desktop/Laptop Analogy<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#desktoplaptop-analogy"></a></h3>
<p>Without DI: You have a laptop computer and you accidentally break the screen. And darn, you find the same model laptop screen is nowhere in the market. So you're stuck.</p>
<p>With DI: You have a desktop computer and you accidentally break the screen. You find you can just grab almost any desktop monitor from the market, and it works well with your desktop.</p>
<p>Your desktop successfully implements DI in this case. It accepts a variety type of monitors, while the laptop does not, it needs a specific screen to get fixed.</p>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"OIBi54r4RJHlcy33iXLpD"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
