<ul>
<li>Think of user testing as high-level workflow tests. While atomic components, such as copy on a button would be tested through A/B testing </li>
<li>always let users drive the test. Instead of giving them imperative instructions (<em>click here, enter your email here, then click here</em>), give declarative tasks (*create a piece of information for your repository)</li>
<li>Be careful not to use any verbiage that is specific to the app when giving users your app
<ul>
<li>ex. for Never Forget, don't use the words nugget and bucket, because it gives them insight that later users won't have the benefit of. If necessary, use more neutral words, like category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the user is going through your app, watch their face for signs of surprise or confusion, and question them on it. Make sure you understand why the user was feeling what they felt.
<ul>
<li>Keep good data on this, because if you start to notice a pattern that occurs at expected areas of the app, then you know you have something that needs to be fixed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parrot people as they tell you things, because it allows them to expand on the feelings that prompted those words. 
<ul>
<li>"I felt a little confused here" —"Oh, you felt confused here?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As they click on something, ask them how well it matched their expectations of what would happen when clicked on it.
<ul>
<li>"was <em>this</em> the screen you were expecting to go to after clicking on <em>that</em> button?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listen for the <em>value gain</em> that the user is suggesting, rather than the specific implementation of that feature.
<ul>
<li>When people make suggestions, focus on the "why" behind those suggestions. Don't focus too much on the implementation of their suggestion. Instead, if you put attention on what goal they are trying to facilitate within their suggestion, then you can extract useful potential information regarding the subject that is receiving the suggestions</li>
<li>ex. Say you have an airbnb like product, and while doing user testing, a user suggests having a back and forward button right on the photo, that takes you to the next property in the list. Maybe you disagree with the design decision of putting the arrows on the main image, but you are missing a valuable piece of feedback here: users may want to navigate more quickly between properties, and may want to do it right from a property page. Take that goal in mind, and devise your own solution for it. The solution could be an overall better navigation system, or just placing the forward/back buttons somewhere else on the page. </li>

<ul>
<li>Everything to do with research can be placed on a grid by how qualitative/quantitative the feedback is, vs the origin of that feedback (what people say vs how they act)</li>

<ul>
<li>Qualitative methods are largely unstructured, tend to be subjective, are at the softer end of science, and are about establishing insights and theories (which we then test, often using quantitative approaches).
<ul>
<li>are open-ended (“How might you improve this customer journey?”) </li>
<li>Qualitative methods lead to insights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quantitative methods are largely: structured, tend to be objective, are at the harder — more measurable — end of science, and are about testing theories. They tend to be larger sample sizes and can be run in a more hands-off manner. With quantitative research, user behaviors and attitudes are gathered indirectly.

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"xBgPw64k3VYJvJvsSfjID"},"buildId":"s-Pdpb0Y8fVIEUakhzEMN","assetPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
