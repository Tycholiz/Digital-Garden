<p>The objective of TDD is to test behaviours in the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is accomplished by writing tests first that describe behaviour of the software, then writing code that passes those tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>While TDD is accomplished with <a href="/notes/AQjiAvYdKm3JHmww0q2V6">Unit Testing</a>, the <em>unit</em> does not necessarily correpond to a class/module. Instead, the system under test can be thought of as an API that implements some behaviour. As a result, a unit may encompass multiple classes, so long as they all achieve some higher level behaviour of the system.</p>
<h2 id="behaviour-nature-of-tdd">Behaviour nature of TDD<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#behaviour-nature-of-tdd"></a></h2>
<p>TDD could be thought of as <em>behavioural testing</em>, if that term wasn't already appropriated by <a href="/notes/Io6ynzCU93aEuqY3g8opd">BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development)</a>. The idea is that we view isolation as modules of behaviour, rather than as individual classes. We define our units as modules that don't cross a port (such as making a network call, or accessing the filesystem). In other words, we test at the level of our <em>units</em>, which perform some self-isolated action that we can test for. Therefore, a unit may involve more than one class. The implementation details are immaterial. What matters is that we can test the inputs and outputs of this unit (the surface area). What this means is that we can structure our unit tests in such a way where we are testing for behaviour. Then, once all the tests are written, we can start to implement the code. Subsequent refactorings of the code shouldn't involve changes to the tests, since tests don't worry about implementation details. The implementation could be one big function, or it could be several.</p>
<ul>
<li>here, isolation is about not crossing ports, rather than sticking to a single class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, the trigger to following a TDD cycle is the necessity of a new method on a class. People think "I need to add a method that does this and that, so I will first write a test to cover that implementation, then write the method to make all tests pass". This is the wrong way to go about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>instead, the trigger should be that the system has a new requirement. Therefore, "I want the software to do this new thing, so I will start by writing tests that test that this system does that thing".</li>
<li>this shows how testing should be declarative, not imperative.
<ul>
<li>we don't test that <code>foo()</code> gets called 2 times when <code>bar()</code> is called. This is a flaky test, since if our implementation changes, it's likely the test will change too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thought of another way, we want to test the API of our software, not the implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we think of individual classes as our units, we tend to mock more heavily. This leads to overspecified tests, whereby we know all the implementation details of our classes via our mocks and how they are called.</p>
<ul>
<li>an overspecified test is a test that makes too many assumptions about how the system under test is implemented, rather than focusing on the system's surface (API). These assumptions lead to tests that break when implementation details change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the focus on software behaviour, TDD forces us to think in terms of what the consumer of that API would find useful. What results are tests that match the way that consumers actually use the code.</p>
<h3 id="red-green-refactor">Red, Green, Refactor<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#red-green-refactor"></a></h3>
<p>Commonly thought to mean <em>"write a test, make sure it fails. Write some code to pass the test. Tidy up a bit"</em>, but actually means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a test that represents the behaviour that is needed from the system. It compiles, but the test fails.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>this represents a requirement for the program</li>
<li>we want to see our test fail because there are no tests for tests.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Write some minimal code to make the test pass. This is as quick-n-dirty as it needs to be, and involves no patterns, no designs, and no structure. Just stick code in a method that might not even belong in that class. As long as it gets the job done, it's good</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>we do this because once we've made the test pass, we've understood how to implement the requirements. 
<ul>
<li>at this point we can move fast. We can feel more free to go to Stackoverflow and copy some code. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>another reason we do this is because we are focusing on one thing at a time: get the behaviour of the code right, then engineer it well. It is far more difficult to do both at the same time, and what often results is either an overengineered solution, or analysis paralysis.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add design: Extract methods, implement a design pattern, create additional classes etc. Clean up the quick-n-dirty</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>refactoring is a process of making safe moves that let us change the design of the code without changing the behaviour. Therefore, no new tests are written at this point.</li>
<li>refactoring is about changing implementation details, not about how that interface has changed. If we think of this in terms of <a href="/notes/12a2891c-e26b-47db-9e2e-7a3de90b672b">OOP</a> it can be thought of as <em>"refactoring doesn't happen in your public properties, only your private ones"</em>. This of course is not absolute, and is more of a guideline. The idea is that we don't want to change our public API, because others depend on it. Instead, our refactoring should focus on how something has been implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we approach testing this way, we move away from creating <a href="/notes/965AqO8bdqbS0Et9bKsUO">test doubles</a> for each class of our classes to depend on, and instead start to create test classes only to replace dependencies at the port (e.g. at the level of network call, file access etc.) </p>
<p>If we isolate testing at the level of classes (as is more typically done), what happens is that we find ourselves having to modify the tests whenever the implementations themselves get refactored. Most of the time the culprit is <a href="/notes/JUu4GPp6TBnRJBbzNQbFw">mocks</a> that need to be changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>modifying tests becomes more problematic down the road when we forget how our tests work (since tests are typically more imperative than the implementations, they can be more difficult to understand)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We may also take a bit of an inverse approach with TDD, and write the code first. In this case, the idea is to write some production code - enough to pass a test or two - and then write those tests. Then, to determine how much code you need to pass a test or two, think of a couple of tests to pass, then write the code that would pass those tests. Then write the tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to work in small chunks, you have to imagine the tests that you'll be writing; so that you can write code that is testable.</li>
<li>The core insight of TDD is the size of the cycle, not so much whether or not you write the test first. The reason we write the tests first is that it encourages us to keep the cycles really short, but we would get pretty much the same benefit if we took a code-first approach, but in similar size cycles.</li>

This of course is not absolute, and is more of a guideline. The idea is that we don't want to change our public API, because others depend on it. Instead, our refactoring should focus on how something has been implemented.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we approach testing this way, we move away from creating \u003ca href=\"/notes/965AqO8bdqbS0Et9bKsUO\"\u003etest doubles\u003c/a\u003e for each class of our classes to depend on, and instead start to create test classes only to replace dependencies at the port (e.g. at the level of network call, file access etc.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we isolate testing at the level of classes (as is more typically done), what happens is that we find ourselves having to modify the tests whenever the implementations themselves get refactored.

In this case, the idea is to write some production code - enough to pass a test or two - and then write those tests. Then, to determine how much code you need to pass a test or two, think of a couple of tests to pass, then write the code that would pass those tests. Then write the tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn order to work in small chunks, you have to imagine the tests that you'll be writing; so that you can write code that is testable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe core insight of TDD is the size of the cycle, not so much whether or not you write the test first. The reason we write the tests first is that it encourages us to keep the cycles really short, but we would get pretty much the same benefit if we took a code-first approach, but in similar size cycles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/11/10/TDD-Doesnt-work.html\"\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"oVfbIz9jQKACNE2FyfskO"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
