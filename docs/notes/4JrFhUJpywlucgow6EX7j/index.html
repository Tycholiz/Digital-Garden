<p>A microservice architecture is variant of the <a href="/notes/BX7Yh5IwYZCsV2BSxvunp">SOA (Service-oriented Architecture)</a> structural style</p>
<ul>
<li>arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services.</li>
<li>services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.</li>
</ul>
<p>goal is that teams can bring their services life independent of others, but it comes at a cost to maintain the decoupling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces need to be designed carefully and treated as a public API.
<ul>
<li>These difficulties are usually solved by either having versioned APIs, or multiple interfaces on the same service (ie. multiple commands that effectively export a documentâ€” just done in different ways)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A microservice is a self-contained piece of business functionality with clear interfaces</p>
<ul>
<li>through its own internal components, it may implement a layered architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>The architecture essentially follows the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well"</p>
<p>It lends itself to a continuous delivery software development process.</p>
<ul>
<li>A change to a small part of the application only requires rebuilding and redeploying only one or a small number of services</li>
</ul>
<p>Adheres to principles such as fine-grained interfaces (to independently deployable services), business-driven development (e.g. domain-driven design).</p>
<p>Microservice architectures are commonly adopted for cloud-native applications, serverless computing, and applications using lightweight container deployment.</p>
<p>When implementing a microservice-based architecture, the most important technology choices are the way microservices communicate with each other (synchronous, asynchronous, UI integration) and the protocols used for the communication (RESTful HTTP, messaging, GraphQL ...). Things like language and infrastructure don't introduce the coupling between services as you'd find in a monolithic app.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a traditional architecture, the choice of language impacts the whole system. This isn't the case in microservices,</li>

<h2 id="considerations-when-to-make-a-service">Considerations when to make a service<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#considerations-when-to-make-a-service"></a></h2>
<p>How many people will be working in the service and how frequently will there be changes?</p>
<ul>
<li>more people working in one codebase results in more merge conflicts and competition for the same resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Services should be determined along product offering boundaries defined by nouns (e.g. Customer, Sales) or verbs (Search, Add to Cart)</p>
<ul>
<li>If ServiceB depends on ServiceA to do its work, then it's a sign that they should live in the same service. Otherwise, a failing service will cause its dependent services to fail. Finding the offending service becomes like finding the burnt out bulb in a christmas tree.</li>
<li>if we need to achieve the separation of team ownership, or if a service is simply getting too large, we may consider writing a simple library.</li>

<h3 id="pros">Pros<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros"></a></h3>
<p>Modularity</p>
<ul>
<li>This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion. This benefit is often argued in comparison to the complexity of monolithic architectures.</li>
<li>developers also gain freedom of implementation and technology choices, negating the need to subject services to the lowest common denominator implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>Scalability</p>
<ul>
<li>Since microservices are implemented and deployed independently of each other, i.e. they run within independent processes, they can be monitored and scaled independently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Integration of heterogeneous and legacy systems</p>
<ul>
<li>microservices is considered as a viable means for modernizing existing monolithic software application. There are experience reports of several companies who have successfully replaced (parts of) their existing software by microservices, or are in the process of doing so. The process for Software modernization of legacy applications is done using an incremental approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed development</p>
<ul>
<li>it parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservice-based architectures facilitate continuous integration, continuous delivery and deployment.
<ul>
<li>teams working on monoliths need to synchronize to deploy together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Increased fault isolation (only when deployed properly)</p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cons"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Services form information barriers.</li>
<li>Inter-service calls over a network have a higher cost in terms of network latency</li>
<li>Testing and deployment are more complicated</li>
<li>Moving responsibilities between services is more difficult. It may involve communication between different engineering teams, depending on how messages are passed between each microservice.</li>
<li>following this paradigm results in a tendency to see the microservice as the atomic unit. This can lead to too many services when the alternative of internal modularization of a more monolithic approach may lead to a simpler design.
<ul>
<li>To make this judgement requires understanding the overall architecture of the applications and interdependencies between components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The architecture introduces additional complexity and new problems to deal with, such as network latency, message format design, Backup/Availability/Consistency (BAC), load balancing and fault tolerance
mat design, Backup/Availability/Consistency (BAC), load balancing and fault tolerance</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, unless implemented properly, you face the risk of...</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower overall availability, especially when those services are deployed in one of a handful of microservice anti-patterns</li>
<li>Longer response times for end users.</li>
<li>Complicated fault isolation and troubleshooting that increases average recovery time for failures.</li>
<li>Service bloat: Too many services to comprehend</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Examples<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#examples"></a></h2>
<h3 id="amazon-product-page">Amazon Product Page<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#amazon-product-page"></a></h3>
<p>Consider that a product page on Amazon gets data from multiple distinct domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product Info Service - basic metadata about the product such as title, author, page count etc.</li>
<li>Pricing Service - product price</li>
<li>Order service - purchase history for product</li>
<li>Inventory service - product availability</li>
<li>Review service - customer reviews </li>
</ul>
<p>The question becomes, how do the clients access each individual service? This is more complex than what we'd have in a monorepo architecture. As such, problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>each client (web, mobile) might not necessarily get the same sets of data (ex. mobile probably shows less information)</li>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"4JrFhUJpywlucgow6EX7j"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
