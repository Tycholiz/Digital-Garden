<p>Domain Driven Design is the concept that we should design our application code with heavy consideration into the business logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>ex. we don't know if it will always be the case that you must be a user to purchase a book. Therefore, we shouldn't design the system in a way where we can't accomplish that easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>DDD is about thinking about your software in terms of business application, instead of looking at it in terms of technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>ie. we are writing for the needs of the business</li>
<li>we achieve this by defining models for our domain, and then writing software that conforms to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>DDD has nothing to do with writing code in a certain way. Rather, it's about understanding the underlying logic behind the problems you need to solve. It's the thinking about domains that drives the design of the code. In a way, DDD is the opposite of jumping right in with code and trying to solve something without thinking about it beforehand.</p>
<ul>
<li>"The novice jumps in right away with code. The veteran ponders the problem they are solving, and thinks (in code) about the logic of that problem"</li>
</ul>
<p>DDD is all about unifying all of the code in a way that is highly comprehensible to those uninvolved with the code's creation. That is, focus is placed on the high level business logic and domain delineations.</p>
<ul>
<li>At a trivial level, it’s all about the names you use for things.  </li>
<li>at the level above that, it’s about the way that you combine and activate things to produce business value.  </li>
<li>at the level above that, it’s the causal and relationship (semantic) model that keeps everything cohesive, coherent, and aligned with the business.  </li>
<li>this alignment can’t come from an implementation-focused model. you must use a domain model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralizes (business) domain logic into the software to account for changes in understanding and business needs and to improve longevity </li>
<li>Helps us understand where we should be investing (strategic) and how to build it (tactical) - investing in the parts of the business that are core </li>
<li>Understanding the problem helps align everyone to produce better solutions and more effective communication</li>
</ul>
<p>Key ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collaboratively model the domain so that your software reads like the problem it solves.</li>
<li>Isolate your software and establish context in each part of it. There should be enough previously handled assertions that you have a good idea of what's going to happen while looking at any random line of code. (Not sure how to word this one)</li>
<li>You don't have to model the domain <em>exactly</em>.
(Use abstraction to get rid of unnecessary details, and sometimes it makes sense to model things as they are used rather than what they actually are)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="domain-model">Domain Model<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#domain-model"></a></h3>
<p>a domain model is an abstraction of the subdomain. Not every aspect of the domain can be part of the model. It's the aspects chosen for implementation that constitute the model.</p>
<ul>
<li>this means that we don't just think in terms of what the object can do; we think of it in terms of what we <em>want</em> it to do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="farmyard-domain-analogy">Farmyard Domain analogy<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#farmyard-domain-analogy"></a></h3>
<p>Imagine we wanted to build a house. We would first need to determine what type of house we are building. Detached? Condo? Duplex? Farmhouse?</p>
<p>After determining this, we would talk to the domain expert, which would probably be a farmer. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notably, it's not the architect, since they wouldn't have the in-depth domain knowledge required to design everything.
<img src="/assets/images/2022-01-10-09-34-42.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domain: Farmyard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sub-domains: Barn, Stables, Farmhouse, Garden gate, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domain model: The layout/plans for each sub-domain (e.g. the layout of the farmhouse)</p>
<ul>
<li>analogous relationship:
<ul>
<li>classes -> objects</li>
<li>domain model -> bounded contexts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ubiquitous language: in the layout, we have rooms like Family room, Bedroom, Bathroom. This is the ubiquitous language of the domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/eJh8ewMkDq2LpJPqC6fX8">Bounded context</a>: The parts circled in blue.</p>
<ul>
<li>language used in each bounded context is specific. For example, "caretaker" of the stables and "caretaker" of the farmhouse are two different things.</li>

tactical design is expected to change over the process of development</p>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"GDJoTJocO8OKbTtSjn2CW"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
