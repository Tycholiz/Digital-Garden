<h2 id="the-process">The Process<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-process"></a></h2>
<p>The MTA receives the email from the MSA, which it receives from the MUA</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the MTA gets the email, relaying comes into play— with the MTAs acting as the relays (SMTP relay)
<ul>
<li>In relaying, the email is forwarded to other MTAs if the recipient of the email is not hosted locally on the same system as the sender.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the relaying process has finished, the email is sent to the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)— which is the last stop before being delivered to a client's mailbox</li>
<li>The whole process uses SMTP, except for the final stage, which is between MDA and and MUA, which uses POP3 or IMAP
<ul>
<li>In other words, the process of getting mail from the "mail server" onto the email client uses POP3/IMAP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>MSA - Mail Submission Agent</li>
<li>MDA - Mail Delivery Agent</li>
<li>MTA - Mail Transfer Agent</li>

<h3 id="mail-transport-agent-mta">Mail Transport Agent (MTA)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#mail-transport-agent-mta"></a></h3>
<p>A mail server can have many names: mail relay, mail router, Internet mailer. But the most common alias is an mail transport agent (MTA)</p>
<ul>
<li>an MTA is responsible for transferring email among users on the internet</li>
<li>MTAs query the MX records and select a mail server to transfer emails</li>
<li>Usually, MTAs use a store-and-forward model of mail handling. This means that outgoing mail is put into a queue and waits for the recipient’s server response. An MTA will recurrently try to send emails. If the mail fails to be delivered during the established term, it will be returned to the mail client.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mta-impact-on-email-deliverability">MTA impact on email deliverability<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#mta-impact-on-email-deliverability"></a></h4>
<p>There are three major factors that email deliverability is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>sender’s reputation</li>
<li>infrastructure &#x26; authentication</li>
<li>content</li>
</ul>
<p>The reputation of the domain and IP address the email is sent from is the most important thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>MTAs can protect and strengthen the reputation of the sender.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="brand-new-ips">Brand new IPs<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#brand-new-ips"></a></h5>
<p>If you’re building your reputation from scratch, you should not use your virgin IP address at full load. It has no email sending history and thus needs some warming up. An MTA will let you do this and later slowly increase sending capacity</p>

<ol>
<li>Alice sends an email to Bob. </li>
<li>In reality, it goes directly to her mail server, where it is placed in a message queue.</li>
<li>The client-side of SMTP (running on Alice's mail server) sees the message sitting in the queue.</li>
<li>In response, it opes up a TCP connection to an SMTP server running on Bob's machine</li>
<li>After the handshaking process is complete, the SMTP client sends Alice's message into the TCP connection.</li>
<li>The message is received by Bob's mail server. The server then places the message in Bob's mailbox.</li>

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"LpE7frn7u1G7OIaM3oxmL"},"buildId":"fo6gubzKP_KV9RZPhaoiQ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
