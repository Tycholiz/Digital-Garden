At the final router, the the router's L1 communicates with the L1 of the destination host, as it makes its way back up to L7.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"airplane-trip-analogy\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#airplane-trip-analogy\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Airplane trip analogy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As we look at the process of planning and taking an airplane, it becomes apparent that there are different layers to the entire process. In fact, each layer appears two times in the whole process— in reverse order:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>buy ticket</li>\n<li>check baggage</li>\n<li>load at gate</li>\n<li>takeoff on runway</li>\n<li>airplane routing (travel)</li>\n<li>land of runway</li>\n<li>unload at gate</li>\n<li>pickup baggage</li>\n<li>complain about ticket.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>each layer implements some functionality, and we can see that the opposite action was performed in reverse order.</li>\n<li>We can also see that each layer provides service to the layer below it.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. the act of checking baggage only makes sense to a ticketed person. </li>\n<li>ex. the idea of unloading at a gate only makes sense to a person on a landed plane.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>we notice that we can replace any layer in the model, as long as the functionality remains the same. In this way, layers are interfaces to each other, and don't care about each other's implementation— only the outcome (ie. output) it provides.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"encapsulation\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#encapsulation\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Encapsulation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>as data travels each layer from L7 down to L1, additional information is added. As we pass the information encapsulated in the HTTP request down to L4, the transport layer takes the information of L7 and adds its own information to it. This information that was added is then used by the transport layer of the next node in the chain (likely the destination host). This process of encapsulation continues on down layer by layer until L1.\n<ul>\n<li>This idea of encapsulation thus demonstrates what is fundamentally different between each PDU: a message (L7) is an encapsulated datagram (L4). In other words, the datagram encapsulates the message. A datagram is fundamentally a message, plus some other information (provided by the layer). Therefore, at each layer, the PDU has 2 types of fields: header fields, and payload fields (the payload is just a packet from the layer above).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"protocol-data-unit-pdu\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#protocol-data-unit-pdu\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Protocol Data Unit (PDU)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>each layer has the concept of a Protocol Data Unit, which is the format that the data exists in within the current Layer. In other words, it is what an atomic unit of data is called at each layer.\n<ul>\n<li>All PDUs are composed of a header and payload</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"miscelaneous\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#miscelaneous\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Miscelaneous</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the very fact that there are layers means that we can treat it as a modular chain, and swap out one L3 implementation for another (such as wifi for ethernet)\n<ul>\n<li>therefore L2 doesn't care if we are using IP or IPX on L3, just like L3 doesn't care if L2 uses wifi or ethernet</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The price we pay by layering is that we have to map between 32 bit IP addresses (L3) and 48 bit MAC addresses (L2).\n<ul>\n<li>The ARP protocol exists to solve this very problem</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The OS may be a participant in any or all of the layers\n<ul>\n<li>ex. at L1, signal processing can be offloaded to a host CPU and that requires a driver which interfaces with the operating system</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"0e1ca097-be9f-4e4c-a7ed-d6dfb05cd4e8","title":"Root","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{"digital-garden":{"type":"header","text":"Digital

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
