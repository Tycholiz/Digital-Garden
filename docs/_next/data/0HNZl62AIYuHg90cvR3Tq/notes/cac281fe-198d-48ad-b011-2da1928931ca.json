The only communication that is available by default is between containers within a pod (via localhost)</p>\n<p>Services should not be used to enable external access to an application.</p>\n<p>Services are based on resources.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. we create a service based on Pods through a ReplicaSet. Put another way, a service is created by exposing the ReplicaSet. This is why we specify the resource type when we are running <code>kubectl expose</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A service is an abstract way to expose an application (running on a set of Pods) as a network service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this decouples work definitions from the pods</li>\n<li>can be thought of as a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them\n<ul>\n<li>the front end shouldn't care which backend it uses. Services allow us to achieve this decoupling</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A service provides access to pods from inside the cluster (<a href=\"/Digital-Garden/notes/c9523d48-0f0d-40f6-bb14-c8c5379908f7\">Kube Proxy</a>) or from outside the cluster (<a href=\"/Digital-Garden/notes/4b436af8-6724-405c-82b5-14c1fc465495\">Kube DNS</a>)</p>\n<p>A service tells the rest of the Kubernetes environment (including other pods and replication controllers) what services your application provides. While pods come and go, the service IP addresses and ports remain the same.  Other applications can find your service through Kurbernetes service discovery</p>\n<p>Since pods of a single service can exist on different machines, it makes sense for us to be able to interact with the service itself, so that we can orchestrate activities between all containers that are part of a service(?)</p>\n<p>When a service is created, it inherits all of the labels of the resource type (eg. ReplicaSet) that the service is based on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The service is not directly associated with any controller (eg. ReplicaSet), but rather it is associated with the underlying Pods via the matching labels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem with services is that each application can be reached through a different port, and we cannot expect users to know the port of each service in our cluster.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is a bad practice to publish fixed ports through Services, because it is likely to result in conflicts or, at the very least, create the additional burden of carefully keeping track of which port belongs to which Service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"service-discovery\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#service-discovery\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Service discovery</h2>\n<p>Services can be discovered through two principal modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Environment variables</li>\n<li>DNS\n<ul>\n<li>DNS is an easier approach</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes converts Service names into DNSes and adds them to the DNS server.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a cluster add-on that is already set up by Minikube.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"services-and-env-variables\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#services-and-env-variables\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Services and Env Variables</h3>\n<p>Every Pod gets environment variables for each of the active Services\n</p><p></p><div class=\"portal-container\">\n<div class=\"portal-head\">\n<div class=\"portal-backlink\">\n<div class=\"portal-title\">From <span class=\"portal-text-title\">CLI</span></div>\n<a href=\"/Digital-Garden/notes/92a23fa5-9754-48bc-b559-c46d36fdc282\" class=\"portal-arrow\">Go to text <span class=\"right-arrow\">→</span></a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"portal-parent-anchor\" class=\"portal-parent\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"portal-parent-fader-top\"></div>\n<div class=\"portal-parent-fader-bottom\"></div><p><code>kubectl exec &#x3C;POD_NAME> env</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>list environment variables available in a Pod</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><p></p><p></p>\n<p>Env provide a reference we can use to connect to a Service and, therefore to the related Pods.</p>\n<p>Through the service IP (<code>kubectl describe svc &#x3C;servicename></code>), we can access the service externally.

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the aha moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
