The resulting binary represents the binary data (a sequence of 8-bit bytes)</p>\n<p>Base64 is designed to carry data stored in binary formats across channels that only reliably support text, not binary.</p>\n<p>Base64 is prevalent in the World Wide Web.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is commonly used to embed image files (and other binary assets) within textual assets like HTML and CSS files</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Base64 has some key differences with hashing. Notably, if you take the string \"I like dogs\" and hash it with a cryptography function like the one Bcrypt uses, you will get a completely different hash than if you change a single character in the string, for instance to \"I like dogs!\". If we are talking Base64 encoding however, the resultant strings will be almost the same. Observe that the strings are the same, except for the end, which is precicely where we find the <code>!</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I like dogs\" -> \"SSBsaWtlIGRvZ3M=\"</li>\n<li>\"I like dogs!\" -> \"SSBsaWtlIGRvZ3Mh\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#example\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Example</h3>\n<p>Taking the following string</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many hands make light work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the quote is encoded into Base64, it is represented as a byte sequence of 8-bit-padded ASCII characters encoded in MIME's Base64 scheme:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TWFueSBoYW5kcyBtYWtlIGxpZ2h0IHdvcmsu</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the encoded value of <code>Man</code> is <code>TWFu</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encoded in ASCII, the characters <code>M</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>n</code> are stored as the byte values <code>77</code>, <code>97</code>, and <code>110</code>, which are the 8-bit binary values <code>01001101</code>, <code>01100001</code>, and <code>01101110</code>.

Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
