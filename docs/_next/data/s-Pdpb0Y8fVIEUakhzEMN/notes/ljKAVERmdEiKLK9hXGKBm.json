If using both npm and yarn, we need both of them, and they need to remain in sync (use yarn's import directive to accomplish this)</li>\n<li>if we didn't have a <code>yarn.lock</code>, then if a co-worker cloned our repo and ran <code>yarn install</code>, they may get different versions of a dependency, since <code>package.json</code> can specify version ranges. \n<ul>\n<li>Instead, since <code>yarn.lock</code> is checked into version control, when the co-worker clones the repo and runs <code>yarn install</code>, <code>yarn.lock</code> will be checked and the version specified will be installed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>critical to have if working on a team or if working alone with a CI server.</li>\n<li><code>yarn.lock</code> gets updated any time a dependency is added, removed or modified\n<ul>\n<li>If we want to ensure <code>yarn.lock</code> is not updated, use <code>--frozen-lockfile</code>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference between <code>--frozen-lockfile</code> and <code>--pure-lockfile</code> is that the former will fail if an update is needed </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In a perfect world, yarn.lock is unnecessary, because the point of semver is that unless the major version changes, the upgraded package will still work. In other words, if the version in package.json is listed as ^16.0.1, then <code>yarn install</code> is free to go to the latest minor version, which doesn't matter since semver defines that as fully backwards compatible.\n<ul>\n<li>however, in the real world not everyone follows semver best practices, and sometimes it is just mistakes which ruin backward compatibility </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"upgrading-packages\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#upgrading-packages\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Upgrading packages</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>if we have a dependency version in <code>package.json</code> specified at <code>^3.9.1</code>, this means that any version between 3.9.1 and 4.0.0 will be acceptable. Of course, since we have a lockfile, upgrades will not automatically happen.</li>\n<li><code>yarn upgrade</code> allows us to upgrade all dependencies in <code>package.json</code>. If we use the <code>^</code> specifier, then the latest version within the range will be added. This will be reflected in <code>yarn.lock</code></li>\n<li>we can ignore the version range by passing the <code>--latest</code> flag.\n<ul>\n<li>This modifies both <code>yarn.lock</code> and <code>package.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We can see all packages that can be upgraded with <code>yarn upgrade-interactive --latest</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"link\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\"

symlinks to local projects, from within the project (with package.json) we are currently in.</li>\n<li>ex. if we have a <code>rn-client</code> project and a <code>components</code> project, and we want to use <code>components</code> within <code>rn-client</code>, we can do the following:\n<ol>\n<li>go to <code>components</code> project and run <code>yarn link</code></li>\n<li>go to <code>rn-client</code> project and run <code>yarn link components</code> (name field of package.json)\n<ul>\n<li>this creates a symlink at <code>rn-client/node_modules/components</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>from <code>rn-client</code> project, <code>import components from 'components'</code> </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>It is meant for development-only purposes</li>\n<li>spec: think of <code>yarn link</code> as exporting the package, and <code>yarn link &#x3C;package></code> as importing it.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"children\"><a

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
