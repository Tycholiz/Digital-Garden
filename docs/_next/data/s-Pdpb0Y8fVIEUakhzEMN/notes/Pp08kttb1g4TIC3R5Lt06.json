If it is, then it can generate a new <a title=\"Private\" style=\"color: brown\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\">access token (Private)</a> and that can be sent to the user</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A refresh token is a special token that is used to generate additional jwt tokens. This allows you to have short-lived access tokens (JWTs) without having to collect credentials every time one expires. The server sends the client this token alongside the access (JWT) and/or ID tokens as part of a user's initial authentication flow\n<ul>\n<li>The refresh token should be saved in the database in the relevant row of the user's table.\n<ul>\n<li>Therefore, we can handle the renewing login with Postgres.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the refresh token can be sent from the server to the client as an <code>HTTPOnly</code> cookie</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A refresh token is not capable of authenticating a user on its own— its only use is to look up active sessions. If it finds one, then the refresh token can be used to generate a new access token.</li>\n<li>Every time a new access token is generated, a refresh token should be generated as well</li>\n<li>a Refresh token is what allows us to login to a website, close the browser, and still be logged in upon reopening it.\n<ul>\n<li>When a new session starts (reopening the browser tab), the app is able to see that there is no JWT in memory, so it triggers a <em>silent refresh</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Imagine we set a jwt to have a lifetime of 15 minutes. Without the refresh token, this means that the server would send back an http 401: unauthorized every 15 minutes (probably at which point your app will log the user out and display the login screen)</li>\n<li>A refresh token has 2 properties:\n<ol>\n<li>It can be used to make an API call (say, <code>/refresh_token</code>) to fetch a new JWT token before the previous JWT expires.</li>\n<li>It can be safely persisted across sessions on the client!</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-refresh-tokens\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\"

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
