You can't just make it <code>flex</code> and have the parent decide whether it is inline, a block or whatever.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The consequence of this is that a parent component cannot properly layout a child component without knowing its internal layout structure. And if it doesn't don't know the child's layout (if it's dynamically supplied for example) then it can't safely do anything with it. So long as this limitation exists, there will never be true layout encapsulation on the web platform.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"element-types-the-display-property\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#element-types-the-display-property\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Element Types: the <code>display</code> property</h2>\n<h3 id=\"block-level-elements\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#block-level-elements\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Block-level elements</h3>\n<p>Occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element, and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a \"block\".\nBrowsers display the block-level element with a newline both before and after the element. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can visualize them as a stack of boxes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The block-level element</p>\n<h4 id=\"examples\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#examples\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Examples</h4>\n<p><code>&#x3C;div></code>, <code>&#x3C;p></code>, <code>&#x3C;h1></code>, <code>&#x3C;ul></code></p>\n<h3 id=\"inline-elements\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#inline-elements\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Inline elements</h3>\n<p>Only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element.\nDoes not start on a new line, and only takes up the width it needs.\nDoes not break the flow of the content.\nYou can't put block elements inside inline elements.\nThe block-direction margin is ignored entirely\nThe padding on inline elements doesnâ€™t affect the height of the line of text</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. <code>padding-top</code> on an <code>&#x3C;a></code> tag won't cause the height of the line of text to change</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All inline elements (not just text) can be laid out by a parent with the <code>text-align</code> property</p>\n<ul>\n<li>also with <code>vertical-align</code>, which would be the inverse property, manipulating upon the vertical axis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"inline-block-elements\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#inline-block-elements\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Inline-block elements</h4>\n<p>Able to have width/height values set.\nWhile <code>transform</code> property can't be used on inline elements, it can be used on inline-block.</p>\n<p>Be careful with inline-block elements.

Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
