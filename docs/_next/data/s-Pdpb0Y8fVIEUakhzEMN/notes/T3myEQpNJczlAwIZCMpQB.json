If you can run your software on your computer, you can almost certainly run it on EC2 without any changes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is one of EC2’s main advantages compared to other types of compute platforms (such as <a href=\"/Digital-Garden/notes/OSdV9FvBG3wDbRNLllg0V\">Lambda</a> ): you don’t have to adapt your application to your host.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With EC2 you get an OS, a file system, access to the server’s hardware, etc.</p>\n<p>Elastic refers to the fact that it can scale up/down as needed automatically</p>\n<p>EC2 has dozens of options you will probably never need, and thus it comes with sensible defaults.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the result of the highly varied workloads and use cases serviced by EC2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Selecting an instance type will be the most consequential decision when provisioning an EC2 instance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are 256+, and can be narrowed to a few categories, defined by what they're optimized for:\n<ul>\n<li>CPU</li>\n<li>Memory</li>\n<li>Network</li>\n<li>Storage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you were building your own server, there would be an infinite number of ways to configure it, but with EC2 you get to pick an instance type from its catalog.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the tradeoff you make as opposed to getting you build your own server, but most likely it shouldn't even be a concern.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"security\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#security\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Security</h3>\n<p>the defaults are sensible, but we may have to modify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The security group\n<ul>\n<li>You can think of security groups as individual firewalls for your instances.

In theory it works, but is often impractical.\nThe main premise of Auto Scaling is that once you decide how much headroom you want, you’ll be able to make that headroom a constant size</p>\n<p>Unless the following 2 are true, then it's probably not worth messing around with auto-scaling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are your EC2 costs high enough that any reduction in usage will be materially significant?</li>\n<li>If your EC2 bill were to go down by 30%—would that be a big deal for your business?</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"how-many-ec2-instances-to-run\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\"

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
