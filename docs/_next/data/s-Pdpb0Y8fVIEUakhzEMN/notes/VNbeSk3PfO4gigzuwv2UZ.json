In a typical CDN setup, a request will first ask the CDN for a piece of static media; the CDN will serve that content if it has it locally available. If it isn’t available, the CDN will query the back-end servers for the file, cache it locally, and serve it to the requesting user.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the system you are building is not large enough to have its own CDN, you can ease a future transition by serving the static media off a separate subdomain (e.g., static.yourservice.com) using a lightweight HTTP server like Nginx, and cut-over the DNS from your servers to a CDN later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A website server normally has a caching server along with it, which will cache the webpage. All requests to the URL will retrieve the content from the cache, until the expiry time is hit. At that point, the user will make a fetch, which will see that the cached content is expired, and will then hit the server, which will retrieve the content, pass it to the caching server, which passes it to the user. All subsequent calls (from other users) will be intercepted by the caching server until it is expired (warm caching)\n<img src=\"/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-03-11-15-50-18.png\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A CDN provider will place servers in many locations, but some of the most important are the connection points at the edge between different networks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Without a CDN, transit may take a slower and/or more convoluted route between source and destination</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Originally, a CDN was like a cache for static assets that don't change, like images, logos, stylesheets. Nowadays, that benefit only make up ~10% of everything a CDN can do. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>while CDNs perform caching, not everything that performs caching is a CDN</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CDNs reduce the importance of where your web server is located, since this would theoretically only impact the timecost of the first fetch of data of each expiry cycle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In practice, this is only true for data that doesn't change often. If we are talking about a Facebook news feed that updates frequently, then you are still going to be interfacing a lot with the server, making the location of your server ultimately still important. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The DNS plays a central role in the CDN </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a CDN is known as a distributed internet service</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-03-11-15-50-32.png\"></p>\n<p>If any of the following is true for your website, you should definitely opt for a CDN:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Large amounts of traffic</li>\n<li>A scattered, international user-base</li>\n<li>Expected growth</li>\n<li>Lots of media content, such as images and videos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the answer to all 4 is no, you won’t notice a difference in speed, but you will still get the benefit of DDoS protection.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"olZIVfSs2uLLr3BppFh4K","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1618676699718,"created":1615482407722,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"},"contentHash":"777fb4dab9bcf63cbfe772245d7e4871","links":[],"anchors":{"digital-garden":{"type":"header","text":"Digital

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
