This could be any frontend framework or library, or even vanilla JavaScript.</li>\n<li>APIs: all server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.</li>\n<li>Markup: templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-03-20-18-45-27.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"examples\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#examples\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Examples</h2>\n<h3 id=\"site-generators\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#site-generators\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Site Generators</h3>\n<p>Next.js, Gatsby, Jekyll</p>\n<h3 id=\"headless-cms\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#headless-cms\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Headless CMS</h3>\n<p>Netflify</p>\n<h2 id=\"architecture\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#architecture\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Architecture</h2>\n<p>Purpose is to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale</p>\n<ul>\n<li>core principles are pre-rendering, and decoupling\n<ul>\n<li>pre-render - to generate the markup which represents a view (front-end) in advance of when it is required.

This process of pre-rendering results in sites which can be served directly from a CDN.

Serving directly from a CDN unlocks speeds and performance that can’t be beat. The more of your app you can push to the edge, the better the user experience.</p>\n<h4 id=\"automating-builds\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#automating-builds\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Automating builds</h4>\n<p>Because Jamstack markup is prebuilt, content changes won’t go live until you run another build. Automating this process will save you lots of frustration. You can do this yourself with webhooks, or use a publishing platform that includes the service automatically.</p>\n<h4 id=\"atomic-deploys\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#atomic-deploys\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Atomic Deploys</h4>\n<p>As Jamstack projects grow really large, new changes might require re-deploying hundreds of files. Uploading these one at a time can cause inconsistent state while the process completes. You can avoid this with a system that lets you do “atomic deploys,” where no changes go live until all changed files have been uploaded.</p>\n<h4 id=\"instant-cache-invalidation\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#instant-cache-invalidation\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Instant Cache Invalidation</h4>\n<p>When the build-to-deploy cycle becomes a regular occurrence, you need to know that when a deploy goes live, it really goes live.

No databases to clone, no complex installs. This reduces contributor friction, and also simplifies staging and testing workflows.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"olZIVfSs2uLLr3BppFh4K","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1618676699718,"created":1615482407722,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"},"contentHash":"777fb4dab9bcf63cbfe772245d7e4871","links":[],"anchors":{"digital-garden":{"type":"header","text":"Digital Garden","value":"digital-garden","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["zFMjbn3xihVNHjUIdZCD1","IK6NOKemuDjhfstJBovKL","RS8qp1GxwtiJopCUHTTtq","ZaTr28eWk1DrXOEsc1YVb","Vi0WYVLZunVM9iR8XZJn3","ngAbg7gluvbt1bY1UIRsi","RCPPXSakm5TvKka8kOmVp","MPx8ykTP57I40WTZvTP7f","ZU5WmdTG1bHoE8RcmZXZG","jqWiyYJff92RjXuUQt9PQ","KihijM8OQvZ4pASkkhqzL","F9vyqvls3OBCujtukqKhy","facc2b01-755a-409f-99f6-57bef2d1501f","m5ov42Vm6mR7RQWTvl1NW","YYt62mSW964cwb5nP0hva","PZxxZ4iESzSlbbHJKxuAZ","UDu62Pa6BaRqlG8uGoMhy","nMCtMXVvjBsJk3iw1zoIO","ANfx9Z4a6ZA0uJuSHtbIJ","BkG557LKUYbH1DnxprEVT","1TaH8zDTM98FZ9SYaeXLM","dc79799f-a55d-48ab-a8be-c48adb1b19c0","f6feef57-b8f5-451f-a09a-7b63f6a07183","4sz47Y0LKs1Si73rWtyyh","5a9fb1df-478e-4687-9be0-5cb97e61ec57","1374e9e9-1cbc-4e1f-b1ca-66b8569533dd","f529cc34-aba0-45ca-ad7e-02ddda318941","0zcauha3il2NqtxZazIo7","9bbd6f68-03b2-41f4-92e4-2ca313e8b450","5a2ab598-fa7e-4471-8bda-9f5831b679ae","uV6w4mZPoohWyZV4Xaad0","RgE0mZLaUjPftFPZsiAoe","mytCOts26Pidush65tdRW","fwUzxfLSPMH1eL8oBoLWx","TbW7PM9bg1y5TGkiWwQ8b","xiSIDeEtIc8X0lpUQlppI","0jxgntiLNHWFuCbzqtFGF","GkdMprLUe4QQULBxmGN6V","4SYc6v5hxY5g6Ip6kjpwO","fqVQpS9FBiXgKsZX3R3sJ","L5JUZlGAGvTxrsEBB7DY8","963c4b54-02bd-4943-a15f-52cf59ffd0f4","TeTedoeS2LdHPR632eCpM","e65188a1-177e-4ab2-99f9-75f85d537621","fajYnbVhCRDi74xn0H30R","bArGdGwqo3iFkyKMyE7qR","4Dcp7gbEVoLLgfu7bXFai","5d700782-fb81-416e-83f9-5dd88260e350","zubgzhNFE6KlTgXcjTz6O","8lpdfWa0cbSq1XJQbcYcY","17I8ZksXvqCH1mRtZDjHp","kF916Ow84qpJJeMRkWMIo","tMLkLcrIHHBz56xVmBLkP","CSePBQ6q7qhowKESqVwt7","laZ4OfLhZNK1Kuy6GaWUr","z5IJblOknQhMzZ5QZh4ye","N36FHxfxzwJfxDY3miWyX","3bb25f58-2b50-4fa3-af55-48ea9f88a081","aOqNcxZh8qN4MoBJcvGTc","u93Rz4fEWGu6VBR30Zraf","9hjMHnKvYT4jLKvuDSXaV","LgW7mTIALODoXc54B3p6S","UYPxfHBFWX7fb6hHU5bB6","qxSOd6SPN8qf9ZUojVFDX","WQoMTf6VXBaxCgksXAVsj","2Mw4XgfyCHXHNOX5yoCIY","UFrwsXzC1yr7Ge8FF8Vbo","a8edc4ac-028b-40ec-872a-e4a005b04b2a","0XJqmcdtcMZu66glBI5O8","lK8r8BXS4ThiUTe4xKIZe","93de42ca-53ea-460a-baa7-b9ec5c47cb1e","Rxs2jaGpdFzqYtP7lAJFJ","aO8W81Z0PyIb6Hs7nOHPW","I01hENHnh8Tqu3Ok8sLzG","evqsPNutOaZ8hcBCqxFQu","zhhxcjZUHdU8uRLwGb9Zh","G1aFACZB2ooWGMGwyd3ZW","YWy1C4tgoaCcw1m8JJsr7","Szj3o5iaNxPpesiCqwrbu","XhvCDW3fIw6h6MhY5ticq","Q70g7SusFZBQXzkuQifv4","AzfWDH3wp7jFpL2EYxBcW","y0fwpZ9qMqirsLiFyOciU","ZF8xj8wwDUqKlrwTrCFZ1","tAJvhqhdfyZZa87QHq1TU","4hRmipi8lxpBLyzWu5JVB","iTg0C7QjvnmqBZeEigJNs","3babc3d2-79ae-470a-9c06-ab8bba2e684e","bF3UsMFya3fMeXWDspVov","ULkfbL9WpktbVYnzhl6Jw","PpNOO8JYWe6dM8wruSa7x","di40pCxDn7IiqE8lFdD46","rmW0mkerqV35I8QPji6lM","3IFIK1ByzeIxZCByryGLN","iImkYAKfkw3beAl6pLbDn","tho65KN0ZpjQlVvP1fEzM","ecDe8DNWrkeQTwpTEvHje","Yqhdd9mSJGN7OJOeyoSD2","NEhsoOfR7J6o01ielAuUm","Ws5tah8tpeyn9tK8VBTg8","Bqpifx2HX3vjLhX9yvhTV","gWAg15uBJgkS2B0wcpMAa","l7V3v2ep1YdDCt7DOr7Ci","yM2PJBdqJnHpD63cPA6sW","qn0bre7eLbi3QMbCfWkUi","fSu0KxFL41IRouotqmbHs","0gtg24Mj1a1bQFPRGQNlO","7iQPBMltLPLbFEz2qbjPu","yoh4pwoXcfELInGKRdYf6","dCGCWXgAmiOZXbdULT1m6","jMavlje07sNa6hSEIE8WA","Xxm0JE4dKHxrQAaZfzvxD","PAEBZCyFBZJyR7OoMZ41E","PQ6km8RgRCuyICBPOYz8f","2bhftt8rGuxYu4pFgNqru","hjYIZpHQWuXfeEoGeJEKW","K2M9bQqVq2eQfm29eslKL","X8obW1iKwYsvNgKWGyCzy","yJwSC7hqYIezTFHf5i0Ev","c4Z7ETcOHUILRMH32Sfjw","qiR6dIu857b9M9kTqjOyK","8vflbCVkwZtYcqdDDTNAz","Ku1OgHMhELajzo61Gx7ye","LUrfhDWo8wuwZu7CN9TV8","osu6JGOnvXJ5gt3tpqWZY","1a6173cd-cf13-4b34-a522-8350bf9a364f","ZgCUp366YrF2Tyky2NT73","S2sBltrPfd8a7ICuD7CuH","oWCuBXOg6JWfZzjmKxmNl","jOmhZ8ovLYTPbpM1vqSDx","FraC6xzLy1ei91l1ICyc9","6ceBas2RE9Q4787GDngH7","734cd78d-0bc9-426b-803d-1efc84dfffe5","k4Bb09px6r0FxIRs49SXV","oaG3H1S9IUBO644nGZigu","Ka7agQJkUMRSWN0uFdkWK","si3z090WsiLasMhJBa1Az","ljKAVERmdEiKLK9hXGKBm","LIcuGYV0DDt1VWbvH6Sed","MgUSrpNCIwDOW4fX3vPOF","bZumdyapJ2H0wWWOmJ45i","QHXEIyeZGIGMVi5Q52UWI","i5Fya3Vzzm0rBT0ctByuo"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
