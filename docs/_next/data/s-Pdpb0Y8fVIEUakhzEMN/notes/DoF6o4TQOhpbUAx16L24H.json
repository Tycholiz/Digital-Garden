You will almost never create a ReplicaSet directly just as youâ€™re not going to create Pods.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead, we tend to create ReplicaSets through <a href=\"/Digital-Garden/notes/ZK0P0va9kOJGsM9X7X2Td\">Deployments</a>. In other words, we use ReplicaSets to create and control Pods, and Deployments to create ReplicaSets (and a few other things).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ReplicaSet <code>MatchLabels</code> are used to identify pods and must be the same as the pod labels</p>\n<p>Since ReplicaSets and Pods are loosely coupled objects with matching labels, we can remove one without deleting the other.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can, however, pass <code>--cascade=true</code> if we want to delete pods that are associated with a RS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ReplicaSet uses labels to decide whether the desired number of Pods is already running in the cluster</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this fact means that if we are to delete a RS and then re-create it, it will use the same pods that were running in the cluster. This shows how a RS knows what the pods it defines look like, and if there is a pod (or pods) already in existence that satisfy that definition, then it will simply consider them as part of its pod # count.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"process-of-creating-a-replicaset\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#process-of-creating-a-replicaset\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Process of Creating a ReplicaSet</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Kubernetes client (kubectl) sent a request to the API server requesting the creation of a ReplicaSet defined in the rs yaml file.</li>\n<li>The controller is watching the API server for new events, and it detected that there is a new ReplicaSet object.</li>\n<li>The controller creates two new pod definitions because we have configured replica value as 2 in the rs yaml file.</li>\n<li>Since the scheduler is watching the API server for new events, it detected that there are two unassigned Pods.</li>\n<li>The scheduler decided which node to assign the Pod and sent that information to the API server.</li>\n<li>Kubelet is also watching the API server.

Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
