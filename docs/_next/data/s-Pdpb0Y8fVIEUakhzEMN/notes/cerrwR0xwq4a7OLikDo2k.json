When it doesn't, we frequently end up with unexpected nulls in our response.\nGraphQL is based on its type system, and depending on what type the GraphQL server receives, it will determine what it should do next.</li>\n<li>If we are trying to execute a query to get all nuggets, then the GraphQL server will see we are querying an object (nuggets). Since it is an object (and therefore not a scalar, which would end the execution cycle), GraphQL server knows that it needs to \"fetch\" those fields on the object. It then checks the type of each field. If they are non-scalar, then it checks for more data. This continues until every field is a scalar type. </li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"user-defined-types\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#user-defined-types\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>User-defined Types</h1>\n<p>In GraphQL we deal with 8 different types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>scalars, enums, lists, objects, input objects, interfaces, unions, non-null</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"scalar\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#scalar\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Scalar</h2>\n<p>Scalar types are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Int</li>\n<li>Float</li>\n<li>String</li>\n<li>Boolean</li>\n<li>ID</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A GraphQL object type has a name and fields, but at some point those fields have to resolve to some concrete data. These basic types of data are called scalars, and they are the \"atomic type\" of GraphQL</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At each type, graphql will keep resolving until it gets to the scalar</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scalar types resolve to a scalar object. By definition, they cannot have sub-selections (fields) in the query.</p>\n<p>All Graphql scalars are representable as strings</p>\n<p>Graphql provides built-in scalars, but type systems can add additional scalars</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Imagine making a scalar called <code>Time</code>, which we define as conforming to ISO-8601. When we query a field of type <code>Time</code>, we can rely on the ability to parse the result with an ISO-8601 parser. On the client, we can use a primitive (such as Date) to represent the value.</li>\n<li>ex. Imagine a scalar called <code>Url</code>. It would still be serialized as a string, but would be guaranteed by the server to be a valid URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"id\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#id\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>ID</h3>\n<p>ID is a wrapped type of kind <code>NON_NULL</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"list\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#list\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>List</h2>\n<p>Represents are sequence of values in Graphql.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A list type is a <em>type modifier</em>, meaning it wraps another type, found in the <code>ofType</code> field.

If however the field we are querying is <code>nullable</code> and the result happens to be <code>null</code>, it will remain at that field and not bubble</li>\n<li>When fields are nullable, you still get partial data: even if you don't have the name, you can still show the age and other fields.

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
