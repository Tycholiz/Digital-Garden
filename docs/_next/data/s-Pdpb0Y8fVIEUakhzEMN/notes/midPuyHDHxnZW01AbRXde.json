If we had a string \"SetValue\", we would match the whole string and not just Set, due to the fact that quantifiers are greedy.</p>\n<p>Because repetition operators are greedy, they (may) have to backtrack to complete the full regex.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Backtracking slows down the regex engine. This isn't noticeable if doing a simple text search in a file, but we start to notice a drain on CPU if we have a regex that we need to backtrack through on each iteration of a loop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most people new to regular expressions will attempt to use <code>&#x3C;.+></code>. They will be surprised when they test it on a string like: This is a <code>&#x3C;EM>first&#x3C;/EM></code> test. You might expect the regex to match <code>&#x3C;EM></code> and when continuing after that match, <code>&#x3C;/EM></code>.</p>\n<p>But it does not. The regex will match <code>&#x3C;EM>first&#x3C;/EM></code>. Obviously not what we wanted. The reason is that the plus is greedy. That is, the plus causes the regex engine to repeat the preceding token as often as possible. Only if that causes the entire regex to fail, will the regex engine backtrack. That is, it will go back to the plus, make it give up the last iteration, and proceed with the remainder of the regex.</p>\n<p>Imagine we had a string <code>This is a &#x3C;EM>first&#x3C;/EM> test.</code>. Not taking into account the greedy nature of repetition operators, a naive approach to match any HTML tag with regex <code>&#x3C;.+></code>. However, this matches the whole substring <code>&#x3C;EM>first&#x3C;/EM></code>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we match the <code>&#x3C;</code> literal</li>\n<li>then we match any character 1+ times</li>\n<li>when we arrive at the first <code>></code> character, we are still evaluating for the <code>.</code>. Since <code>></code> is a part of the <code>.</code> set (ie every character), it gets interpreted as such</li>\n<li>by virtue of the <code>.</code>, we arrive at the end of the sentence, so we have <code>&#x3C;EM>first&#x3C;/EM> test.</code></li>\n<li>now the engine realizes that it is at the end of the string, and it still have more things to match (ie. the <code>></code> character), so it backtracks until it reaches that character in <code>&#x3C;/EM></code>.</li>\n<li><code>&#x3C;EM>first&#x3C;/EM></code> is matched\n<ul>\n<li>because of the eagerness, the regex engine is eager to return a match. Therefore, it will not backtrack more than it has to. Once it has found a full match, it will return it. Because of the greediness, this is the leftmost longest match.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"turning-greediness-off\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\"

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
