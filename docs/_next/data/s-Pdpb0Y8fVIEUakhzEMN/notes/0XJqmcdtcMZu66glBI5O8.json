Complete with each package, will be a package.json and a corresponding node_modules directory</p>\n<p>We can list one of our packages as a dependency of another one by including the package in the <code>dependencies</code> section of the dependent's <code>package.json</code> </p>\n<p>The root of a project with Lerna will have a <code>lerna.json</code>, as well as a <code>packages/</code> directory</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Each sub-package of our project must be within the <code>packages/</code> directory </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To run <code>lerna bootstrap</code> is to install all dependencies in sub-modules</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we run <code>bootstrap</code>, lerna will call <code>yarn</code> in each module, then create symlinks between the packages that refer to each other in the dependent's <code>node_modules</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. If we have 3 modules: Addition, Subtraction, and Calc (which performs the add/subtract operations), then Calc's <code>node_modules</code> will contain symlinks to the Addition and Subtraction modules. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if we use hoisting, then symlinks don't play a part. Instead, if we have <code>react</code> in 2 different submodules, then hoisting will allow us to remove <code>react</code> from those submodules, install it at the root level, then allow the node recursive resolver to handle resolution for us. In other words, from within the submodule, when we require <code>react</code>, it will look for the package in its nearest <code>node_modules</code>, not find it, then continue upwards until it does, which will be at the root.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The reason why hoisting works is due to the resolve algorithm of node require</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"duplication\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#duplication\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Duplication</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>naturally, having multiple sub-packages in a project will result in duplicate package listings. Lerna offers hoisting, which allows us to effectively list the same package in multiple places, but have the packages install at the root level\n<ul>\n<li>therefore, the duplicated package (ex. React) will be in the root directory's <code>node_modules</code>, even though it is listed in the sub-package's <code>package.json</code> </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If we have a project with 2 sub-modules: A and B, and both have React as a dependency, we can run <code>lerna bootstrap --hoist</code> at the root, which will remove React (and all of its dependencies) from <code>A/node_modules</code> and <code>B/node_modules</code>, and move them to the root level <code>node_modules</code>. Because of the recursive nature of how <code>node_modules</code> are resolved, this will cause the sub-module's package.json to look upwards in the directory hierarchy until the react binary is found. \n<ul>\n<li>Lerna will warn us when running this command if we have version mismatches</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"commands\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#commands\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Commands</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>bootstrap</code> - generate <code>node_modules</code> for packages.</li>\n<li><code>clean</code> - remove all <code>node_modules</code> that are not in root directory</li>\n<li><code>create</code> - add a new sub-package to your project</li>\n<li><code>run</code> -

Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
