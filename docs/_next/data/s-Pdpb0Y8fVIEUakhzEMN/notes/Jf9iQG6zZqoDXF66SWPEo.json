Named objects are accessed either by \"qualifying\" their names with the schema name as a prefix, or by setting a search path that includes the desired schema(s). A CREATE command specifying an unqualified object name creates the object in the current schema (the one at the front of the search path, which can be determined with the function current_schema).</li>\n<li>\"a schema is a namespace that contains named database objects such as tables, views, indexes, data types, functions, stored procedures and operators.\"</li>\n<li>A database can contain one or multiple schemas and each schema belongs to only one database.</li>\n<li>ex. you may have sales schema that has staff table and the public schema which also has the staff table.

This is the main part of your database.\n<strong>app_hidden</strong> - same privileges as <code>app_public</code>, but it's not intended to be exposed publicly. It's like \"implementation details\" of your app_public schema. You may not need it often.\n<strong>app_private</strong> - SUPER SECRET STUFF üïµÔ∏è No-one should be able to read this without a SECURITY DEFINER function letting them selectively do things. This is where you store passwords (bcrypted), access tokens (hopefully encrypted), etc. It should be impossible (thanks to RBAC (GRANT/REVOKE)) for web users to access this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>security definer effectively changes the role for the function being executed</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"user-tables\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#user-tables\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>\"User\" tables</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>we should have 2 different tables about users. One should be on the private schema (<code>user_account</code>), where password and email will be kept. The other should be on the public schema, where everything else about the user is kept. The two tables have a 1:1 relationship, where the <code>private.user_account</code> table has a reference to the <code>public.user</code> table.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dijam/graphile-jwt-example/blob/master/db.sql\">good example</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>According to the SQL standard, the owner of a schema always owns all objects within it. PostgreSQL allows schemas to contain objects owned by users other than the schema owner. This can happen only if the schema owner grants the CREATE privilege on their schema to someone else, or a superuser chooses to create objects in it.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"olZIVfSs2uLLr3BppFh4K","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1618676699718,"created":1615482407722,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"},"contentHash":"777fb4dab9bcf63cbfe772245d7e4871","links":[],"anchors":{"digital-garden":{"type":"header","text":"Digital Garden","value":"digital-garden","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["zFMjbn3xihVNHjUIdZCD1","IK6NOKemuDjhfstJBovKL","RS8qp1GxwtiJopCUHTTtq","ZaTr28eWk1DrXOEsc1YVb","Vi0WYVLZunVM9iR8XZJn3","ngAbg7gluvbt1bY1UIRsi","RCPPXSakm5TvKka8kOmVp","MPx8ykTP57I40WTZvTP7f","ZU5WmdTG1bHoE8RcmZXZG","jqWiyYJff92RjXuUQt9PQ","KihijM8OQvZ4pASkkhqzL","F9vyqvls3OBCujtukqKhy","facc2b01-755a-409f-99f6-57bef2d1501f","m5ov42Vm6mR7RQWTvl1NW","YYt62mSW964cwb5nP0hva","PZxxZ4iESzSlbbHJKxuAZ","UDu62Pa6BaRqlG8uGoMhy","nMCtMXVvjBsJk3iw1zoIO","ANfx9Z4a6ZA0uJuSHtbIJ","BkG557LKUYbH1DnxprEVT","1TaH8zDTM98FZ9SYaeXLM","dc79799f-a55d-48ab-a8be-c48adb1b19c0","f6feef57-b8f5-451f-a09a-7b63f6a07183","4sz47Y0LKs1Si73rWtyyh","5a9fb1df-478e-4687-9be0-5cb97e61ec57","1374e9e9-1cbc-4e1f-b1ca-66b8569533dd","f529cc34-aba0-45ca-ad7e-02ddda318941","0zcauha3il2NqtxZazIo7","9bbd6f68-03b2-41f4-92e4-2ca313e8b450","5a2ab598-fa7e-4471-8bda-9f5831b679ae","uV6w4mZPoohWyZV4Xaad0","RgE0mZLaUjPftFPZsiAoe","mytCOts26Pidush65tdRW","fwUzxfLSPMH1eL8oBoLWx","TbW7PM9bg1y5TGkiWwQ8b","xiSIDeEtIc8X0lpUQlppI","0jxgntiLNHWFuCbzqtFGF","GkdMprLUe4QQULBxmGN6V","4SYc6v5hxY5g6Ip6kjpwO","fqVQpS9FBiXgKsZX3R3sJ","L5JUZlGAGvTxrsEBB7DY8","963c4b54-02bd-4943-a15f-52cf59ffd0f4","TeTedoeS2LdHPR632eCpM","e65188a1-177e-4ab2-99f9-75f85d537621","fajYnbVhCRDi74xn0H30R","bArGdGwqo3iFkyKMyE7qR","4Dcp7gbEVoLLgfu7bXFai","5d700782-fb81-416e-83f9-5dd88260e350","zubgzhNFE6KlTgXcjTz6O","8lpdfWa0cbSq1XJQbcYcY","17I8ZksXvqCH1mRtZDjHp","kF916Ow84qpJJeMRkWMIo","tMLkLcrIHHBz56xVmBLkP","CSePBQ6q7qhowKESqVwt7","laZ4OfLhZNK1Kuy6GaWUr","z5IJblOknQhMzZ5QZh4ye","N36FHxfxzwJfxDY3miWyX","3bb25f58-2b50-4fa3-af55-48ea9f88a081","aOqNcxZh8qN4MoBJcvGTc","u93Rz4fEWGu6VBR30Zraf","9hjMHnKvYT4jLKvuDSXaV","LgW7mTIALODoXc54B3p6S","UYPxfHBFWX7fb6hHU5bB6","qxSOd6SPN8qf9ZUojVFDX","WQoMTf6VXBaxCgksXAVsj","2Mw4XgfyCHXHNOX5yoCIY","UFrwsXzC1yr7Ge8FF8Vbo","a8edc4ac-028b-40ec-872a-e4a005b04b2a","0XJqmcdtcMZu66glBI5O8","lK8r8BXS4ThiUTe4xKIZe","93de42ca-53ea-460a-baa7-b9ec5c47cb1e","Rxs2jaGpdFzqYtP7lAJFJ","aO8W81Z0PyIb6Hs7nOHPW","I01hENHnh8Tqu3Ok8sLzG","evqsPNutOaZ8hcBCqxFQu","zhhxcjZUHdU8uRLwGb9Zh","G1aFACZB2ooWGMGwyd3ZW","YWy1C4tgoaCcw1m8JJsr7","Szj3o5iaNxPpesiCqwrbu","XhvCDW3fIw6h6MhY5ticq","Q70g7SusFZBQXzkuQifv4","AzfWDH3wp7jFpL2EYxBcW","y0fwpZ9qMqirsLiFyOciU","ZF8xj8wwDUqKlrwTrCFZ1","tAJvhqhdfyZZa87QHq1TU","4hRmipi8lxpBLyzWu5JVB","iTg0C7QjvnmqBZeEigJNs","3babc3d2-79ae-470a-9c06-ab8bba2e684e","bF3UsMFya3fMeXWDspVov","ULkfbL9WpktbVYnzhl6Jw","PpNOO8JYWe6dM8wruSa7x","di40pCxDn7IiqE8lFdD46","rmW0mkerqV35I8QPji6lM","3IFIK1ByzeIxZCByryGLN","iImkYAKfkw3beAl6pLbDn","tho65KN0ZpjQlVvP1fEzM","ecDe8DNWrkeQTwpTEvHje","Yqhdd9mSJGN7OJOeyoSD2","NEhsoOfR7J6o01ielAuUm","Ws5tah8tpeyn9tK8VBTg8","Bqpifx2HX3vjLhX9yvhTV","gWAg15uBJgkS2B0wcpMAa","l7V3v2ep1YdDCt7DOr7Ci","yM2PJBdqJnHpD63cPA6sW","qn0bre7eLbi3QMbCfWkUi","fSu0KxFL41IRouotqmbHs","0gtg24Mj1a1bQFPRGQNlO","7iQPBMltLPLbFEz2qbjPu","yoh4pwoXcfELInGKRdYf6","dCGCWXgAmiOZXbdULT1m6","jMavlje07sNa6hSEIE8WA","Xxm0JE4dKHxrQAaZfzvxD","PAEBZCyFBZJyR7OoMZ41E","PQ6km8RgRCuyICBPOYz8f","2bhftt8rGuxYu4pFgNqru","hjYIZpHQWuXfeEoGeJEKW","K2M9bQqVq2eQfm29eslKL","X8obW1iKwYsvNgKWGyCzy","yJwSC7hqYIezTFHf5i0Ev","c4Z7ETcOHUILRMH32Sfjw","qiR6dIu857b9M9kTqjOyK","8vflbCVkwZtYcqdDDTNAz","Ku1OgHMhELajzo61Gx7ye","LUrfhDWo8wuwZu7CN9TV8","osu6JGOnvXJ5gt3tpqWZY","1a6173cd-cf13-4b34-a522-8350bf9a364f","ZgCUp366YrF2Tyky2NT73","S2sBltrPfd8a7ICuD7CuH","oWCuBXOg6JWfZzjmKxmNl","jOmhZ8ovLYTPbpM1vqSDx","FraC6xzLy1ei91l1ICyc9","6ceBas2RE9Q4787GDngH7","734cd78d-0bc9-426b-803d-1efc84dfffe5","k4Bb09px6r0FxIRs49SXV","oaG3H1S9IUBO644nGZigu","Ka7agQJkUMRSWN0uFdkWK","si3z090WsiLasMhJBa1Az","ljKAVERmdEiKLK9hXGKBm","LIcuGYV0DDt1VWbvH6Sed","MgUSrpNCIwDOW4fX3vPOF","bZumdyapJ2H0wWWOmJ45i","QHXEIyeZGIGMVi5Q52UWI","i5Fya3Vzzm0rBT0ctByuo"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
