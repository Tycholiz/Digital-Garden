This prototype is designed by a company. The company will design a product that creates in you a \"desire\" to get a certain job done. By virtue of the process, the product then becomes the only means of fulfilling that new need and thereby \"getting the job done\".</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Progress can only happen when we attach and integrate new ideas and new products into our lives. This is the basis for why people gain new jobs to be done. </li>\n<li>When people start to understand there is a new <em>job to be done</em>, they start imagining the product integrated in their life, along with all of the benefits that the product provides.</li>\n<li>Having a JTBD is a process. A JTBD is not a thing that consumers have, but rather something that they participate in (an analogy is falling in love, which is something we participate in.)</li>\n<li>A JTBD is distinct from a task (which would be something like \"search a song and add it to your playlist\").</li>\n<li>A JTBD describes \"a better me\". It answers the question, “How are you better since you started using [product]?”\n<img src=\"/Digital-Garden/:/8f843f4b9f7743bcb5c3c3a3b9386bf7\" alt=\"fdf33f277db063fad011a2c2fda8b79c.png\"></li>\n<li>People use only one solution at a time for a JTBD.</li>\n<li>People that are in the process of discovering a solution to a JTBD engage in a mental simulation of that product helping them become better.</li>\n<li>People don't want the product — they want help making their lives better.</li>\n<li>JTBD is a useful framework because it helps you keep your mind on what core value you add to the customer's life. This drives innovation in the right direction. \n<ul>\n<li>If you were a company that made horse-drawn carriages before cars were made, you should have realized at some point that the job to be done for your customers was to have specific (and imaginable) benefits that arise from being able to travel fast. As long as your product is doing the best job it can in satisfying that customer's job to be done, they will remain a client. As cars come along, customers would have much to gain by switching from your horse-drawn carriage, since the car helps the customer become more efficient in fulfilling his job to be done.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Linkedin using JTBD\n<img src=\"/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-10-27-20-09-48.png\">\n<pre><code>- All these options aren't describing the product, but are rather describing progress (how can you improve as a result of using the product).\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"olZIVfSs2uLLr3BppFh4K","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1618676699718,"created":1615482407722,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"},"contentHash":"777fb4dab9bcf63cbfe772245d7e4871","links":[],"anchors":{"digital-garden":{"type":"header","text":"Digital Garden","value":"digital-garden","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["zFMjbn3xihVNHjUIdZCD1","IK6NOKemuDjhfstJBovKL","RS8qp1GxwtiJopCUHTTtq","ZaTr28eWk1DrXOEsc1YVb","Vi0WYVLZunVM9iR8XZJn3","ngAbg7gluvbt1bY1UIRsi","RCPPXSakm5TvKka8kOmVp","MPx8ykTP57I40WTZvTP7f","ZU5WmdTG1bHoE8RcmZXZG","jqWiyYJff92RjXuUQt9PQ","KihijM8OQvZ4pASkkhqzL","F9vyqvls3OBCujtukqKhy","facc2b01-755a-409f-99f6-57bef2d1501f","m5ov42Vm6mR7RQWTvl1NW","YYt62mSW964cwb5nP0hva","PZxxZ4iESzSlbbHJKxuAZ","UDu62Pa6BaRqlG8uGoMhy","nMCtMXVvjBsJk3iw1zoIO","ANfx9Z4a6ZA0uJuSHtbIJ","BkG557LKUYbH1DnxprEVT","1TaH8zDTM98FZ9SYaeXLM","dc79799f-a55d-48ab-a8be-c48adb1b19c0","f6feef57-b8f5-451f-a09a-7b63f6a07183","4sz47Y0LKs1Si73rWtyyh","5a9fb1df-478e-4687-9be0-5cb97e61ec57","1374e9e9-1cbc-4e1f-b1ca-66b8569533dd","f529cc34-aba0-45ca-ad7e-02ddda318941","0zcauha3il2NqtxZazIo7","9bbd6f68-03b2-41f4-92e4-2ca313e8b450","5a2ab598-fa7e-4471-8bda-9f5831b679ae","uV6w4mZPoohWyZV4Xaad0","RgE0mZLaUjPftFPZsiAoe","mytCOts26Pidush65tdRW","fwUzxfLSPMH1eL8oBoLWx","TbW7PM9bg1y5TGkiWwQ8b","xiSIDeEtIc8X0lpUQlppI","0jxgntiLNHWFuCbzqtFGF","GkdMprLUe4QQULBxmGN6V","4SYc6v5hxY5g6Ip6kjpwO","fqVQpS9FBiXgKsZX3R3sJ","L5JUZlGAGvTxrsEBB7DY8","963c4b54-02bd-4943-a15f-52cf59ffd0f4","TeTedoeS2LdHPR632eCpM","e65188a1-177e-4ab2-99f9-75f85d537621","fajYnbVhCRDi74xn0H30R","bArGdGwqo3iFkyKMyE7qR","4Dcp7gbEVoLLgfu7bXFai","5d700782-fb81-416e-83f9-5dd88260e350","zubgzhNFE6KlTgXcjTz6O","8lpdfWa0cbSq1XJQbcYcY","17I8ZksXvqCH1mRtZDjHp","kF916Ow84qpJJeMRkWMIo","tMLkLcrIHHBz56xVmBLkP","CSePBQ6q7qhowKESqVwt7","laZ4OfLhZNK1Kuy6GaWUr","z5IJblOknQhMzZ5QZh4ye","N36FHxfxzwJfxDY3miWyX","3bb25f58-2b50-4fa3-af55-48ea9f88a081","aOqNcxZh8qN4MoBJcvGTc","u93Rz4fEWGu6VBR30Zraf","9hjMHnKvYT4jLKvuDSXaV","LgW7mTIALODoXc54B3p6S","UYPxfHBFWX7fb6hHU5bB6","qxSOd6SPN8qf9ZUojVFDX","WQoMTf6VXBaxCgksXAVsj","2Mw4XgfyCHXHNOX5yoCIY","UFrwsXzC1yr7Ge8FF8Vbo","a8edc4ac-028b-40ec-872a-e4a005b04b2a","0XJqmcdtcMZu66glBI5O8","lK8r8BXS4ThiUTe4xKIZe","93de42ca-53ea-460a-baa7-b9ec5c47cb1e","Rxs2jaGpdFzqYtP7lAJFJ","aO8W81Z0PyIb6Hs7nOHPW","I01hENHnh8Tqu3Ok8sLzG","evqsPNutOaZ8hcBCqxFQu","zhhxcjZUHdU8uRLwGb9Zh","G1aFACZB2ooWGMGwyd3ZW","YWy1C4tgoaCcw1m8JJsr7","Szj3o5iaNxPpesiCqwrbu","XhvCDW3fIw6h6MhY5ticq","Q70g7SusFZBQXzkuQifv4","AzfWDH3wp7jFpL2EYxBcW","y0fwpZ9qMqirsLiFyOciU","ZF8xj8wwDUqKlrwTrCFZ1","tAJvhqhdfyZZa87QHq1TU","4hRmipi8lxpBLyzWu5JVB","iTg0C7QjvnmqBZeEigJNs","3babc3d2-79ae-470a-9c06-ab8bba2e684e","bF3UsMFya3fMeXWDspVov","ULkfbL9WpktbVYnzhl6Jw","PpNOO8JYWe6dM8wruSa7x","di40pCxDn7IiqE8lFdD46","rmW0mkerqV35I8QPji6lM","3IFIK1ByzeIxZCByryGLN","iImkYAKfkw3beAl6pLbDn","tho65KN0ZpjQlVvP1fEzM","ecDe8DNWrkeQTwpTEvHje","Yqhdd9mSJGN7OJOeyoSD2","NEhsoOfR7J6o01ielAuUm","Ws5tah8tpeyn9tK8VBTg8","Bqpifx2HX3vjLhX9yvhTV","gWAg15uBJgkS2B0wcpMAa","l7V3v2ep1YdDCt7DOr7Ci","yM2PJBdqJnHpD63cPA6sW","qn0bre7eLbi3QMbCfWkUi","fSu0KxFL41IRouotqmbHs","0gtg24Mj1a1bQFPRGQNlO","7iQPBMltLPLbFEz2qbjPu","yoh4pwoXcfELInGKRdYf6","dCGCWXgAmiOZXbdULT1m6","jMavlje07sNa6hSEIE8WA","Xxm0JE4dKHxrQAaZfzvxD","PAEBZCyFBZJyR7OoMZ41E","PQ6km8RgRCuyICBPOYz8f","2bhftt8rGuxYu4pFgNqru","hjYIZpHQWuXfeEoGeJEKW","K2M9bQqVq2eQfm29eslKL","X8obW1iKwYsvNgKWGyCzy","yJwSC7hqYIezTFHf5i0Ev","c4Z7ETcOHUILRMH32Sfjw","qiR6dIu857b9M9kTqjOyK","8vflbCVkwZtYcqdDDTNAz","Ku1OgHMhELajzo61Gx7ye","LUrfhDWo8wuwZu7CN9TV8","osu6JGOnvXJ5gt3tpqWZY","1a6173cd-cf13-4b34-a522-8350bf9a364f","ZgCUp366YrF2Tyky2NT73","S2sBltrPfd8a7ICuD7CuH","oWCuBXOg6JWfZzjmKxmNl","jOmhZ8ovLYTPbpM1vqSDx","FraC6xzLy1ei91l1ICyc9","6ceBas2RE9Q4787GDngH7","734cd78d-0bc9-426b-803d-1efc84dfffe5","k4Bb09px6r0FxIRs49SXV","oaG3H1S9IUBO644nGZigu","Ka7agQJkUMRSWN0uFdkWK","si3z090WsiLasMhJBa1Az","ljKAVERmdEiKLK9hXGKBm","LIcuGYV0DDt1VWbvH6Sed","MgUSrpNCIwDOW4fX3vPOF","bZumdyapJ2H0wWWOmJ45i","QHXEIyeZGIGMVi5Q52UWI","i5Fya3Vzzm0rBT0ctByuo"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
