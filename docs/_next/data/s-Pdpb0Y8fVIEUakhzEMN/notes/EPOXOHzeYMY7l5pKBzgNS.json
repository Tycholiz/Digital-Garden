Everyone has a concept of 3:00 in the afternoon. It doesn't matter which timezone you are in, because 3:00 will have a certain feel. We ignore the timezone (spatial coordinate) when it comes to conceptualizing the time. It falls secondary to the time (temporal coordinate).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This problem results in people having a poor conception of how their timezone relates to others. This is why <code>-07:00</code> is a pretty abstract concept, and thus meaningless to most people.</li>\n<li>When talking about time, people almost always leave out some crucial information, leaning on the context of what they are saying to help communicate.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. to denote a year people often shorten to 2 digits ('04).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"other-issues\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#other-issues\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Other issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scientific time naturally has origin 0, as usual with scientific measures, even though the rest of human time notations tend to have origin 1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"unix-time\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#unix-time\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Unix time</h4>\n<p>The Unix-time way of solving time-related problems is to set time 0 equal to 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. This approach works well as long as the rules for converting between relative and absolute time are stable. As it turns out, they are not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some have used local time as the point of reference, some use decoded local time as the reference, and some use hardware clocks that try to maintain time suitable for direct human consumption. Without consistency, problems arise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"political-time\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#political-time\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Political Time</h4>\n<p>On the surface, answering the question \"how long does it take for a clock to show the same value?\" is an easy one to answer. The answer is 24 hours, right? Well, this question gets complex when we consider daylight savings, since 1/365 days will have 23 hours, and 1/365 days will have 25 hours.</p>\n<p>There is no way you can know from your location alone which time zone applies at some particular point on the face of the earth: you have to ask the people who live there what they have decided.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, political time is what people want their computers to produce when asking for time of day.</p>\n<h1 id=\"ue-resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#ue-resources\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
