First, the customer signals their intent to make a purchase, then an invoice is generated. We have these as two decoupled systems. At least, that's what they appear to be:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-11-22-15-02-44.png\"></p>\n<p>But what happens when you start to create more services downstream from the Order Service?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-11-22-15-14-23.png\"></p>\n<p>Here, each downstream service must publish its own API, and the Order Service becomes responsible for talking to each of them. To accomplish this, the Order Service must understand retry semantics for each service, as well as bundle an SDK for each. As more downstream services are introduced, they become dependent on the Order Service, introducing an integration cost to hooking up to the Order Service.</p>\n<p>This architecture also has a tendency to get complicated easily. Imagine the FulfillmentService doesn't have the item in stock, and therefore has to inform the InvoiceService? Then we have to choreograph the flow of all of this business logic.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine that someone created a RewardsService to track consumer reward points, but your team wasn't informed. Now the RewardService is in a position where it doesn't know what's happened.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#overview\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Overview</h2>\n<p>Events are observable, not directed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Payment Domain example, the Service APIs used direct commands, whereas the event-driven approach is observable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-11-22-15-21-57.png\"></p>\n<p>The benefit of the event-driven approach is that the services emitting the events don't have to have any knowledge about who is listening to those events. That burden is removed from the emitter and placed onto the consuming service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The end result is that service can consume upstream events without requiring upstream changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The event producer sends events to an event bus via an endpoint. A router manages directing and filtering those events to the appropriate downstream consumers.</p>\n<p>Now, we have an architecture where the OrderService sends events to the Event bus, which gets configured to recognize which downstream services should be notified of the event.\n<img src=\"/Digital-Garden/assets/images/2021-11-22-15-26-31.png\"></p>\n<p>Another benefit of this architecture is that if OrderService throws an error, it can send an Error event to the event bus, and all the subscribed nodes will be notified of it so they can act accordingly.</p>\n<p>In the above example, we were at a disadvantage when one team added a RewardService without telling the OrderService team. In this Event-driven architecture, the RewardService team only needs to add a new rule to the bus to be subscribed to emitted events from OrderService.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\"><a

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
