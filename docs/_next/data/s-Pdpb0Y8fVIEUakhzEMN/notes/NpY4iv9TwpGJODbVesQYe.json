Rather, published messages are characterized into channels, without knowledge of what (if any) subscribers there may be. Subscribers express interest in one or more channels, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what (if any) publishers there are. This decoupling of publishers and subscribers can allow for greater scalability and a more dynamic network topology.</p>\n<p>Pub-Sub is a paradigm for getting real-time updates to a client. It is unlike webhooks, which would require the publisher of information to explicitly call someone who has \"signed up\" to receive it. Instead, with Pub-Sub the publisher determines that there is a certain set of information that it wants to send out, and it specifies a container (the topic) that it will be sent to. This leaves the topic open to be subscribed to, which a subscriber (a client) may do. The subscriber specifies that it is interested in receiving any new messages that arrive in a specific Topic (by name), and when new messages arrive, they are sent to the client.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This topic name would be scoped for a specific user, for instance we might call it <code>graphql:user:${userId}</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A common example of pub-sub are push notifications on mobile devices, since information preferences are expressed in advance by the user.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A client \"subscribes\" to various information \"channels\" provided by a server; whenever new content is available on one of those channels, the server pushes that information out to the client.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A subscriber receives messages either by Pub/Sub pushing them to the subscriber's chosen endpoint, or by the subscriber pulling them from the service. Upon successful receiving of the message, the subscriber informs that it was received successfully.</p>\n<p>Pub-sub is a messaging pattern whereby senders of messages (publishers) do not program the messages to be sent to the receivers (subscribers). Instead, the publishers categorize published messages into classes, without knowing who the subscribers are that will ultimately consume those messages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest to them (without any knowledge about who the publishers are)</li>\n<li>This above explanation shows that the Pub-Sub paradigm results in the publisher service and the subscriber service being decoupled from one another.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An RSS feed might be a good analogy for the Pub-Sub paradigm, if we consider that we don't really care where each post/article came from. We just get them all lumped together, and consume them there, without any real consideration to where they came from. The process is decoupled.</p>\n<p>Communication may be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>1:many (fan-out)\n<ul>\n<li>or, many clients subscribing to one topic (ie. multiple subscriptions to 1 topic)</li>\n<li>ex.

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
