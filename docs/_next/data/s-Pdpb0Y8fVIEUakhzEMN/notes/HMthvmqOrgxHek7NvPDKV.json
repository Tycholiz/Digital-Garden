Transit (or pay) – The network operator pays money (or settlement) to another network for Internet access (or transit).\n\t2. Peer (or swap) – Two networks exchange traffic between their users freely, and for mutual benefit.\n- Therefore, in order for a network to reach any specific other network on the Internet, it must either:\n\t1. Sell transit (or Internet access) service to that network (making them a 'customer'),\n\t2. Peer directly with that network, or with a network which sells transit service to that network\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>the internet is based on the principle that any Internet user can reach any other Internet user as though they were on the same network (<em>global reachability</em>)\n<ul>\n<li>Therefore, any Internet connected network must by definition either pay another network for transit, or peer with every other network which also does not purchase transit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Think of the internet as a huge tree with lots of leaves and branches. Your router is the stem of a single leaf (your home). It connects that leaf to the rest of the tree. It doesn't need to know where everything else is, it just needs to know how to transfer data between the twig it is on and the leaf it is connected to. The twig knows what it's connected to, and so on. Some parts of the tree connect directly to many other parts. For example, the trunk is connected to every branch. But, it still has to pass information through those branches and rely upon them to get it to the right twig and leaf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Internet is literally a network of networks, and it’s bound together by BGP. BGP allows one network (say Facebook) to advertise its presence to other networks that form the Internet. As we write Facebook is not advertising its presence, ISPs and other networks can’t find Facebook’s network and so it is unavailable.</p>\n<p>The individual networks each have an ASN: an Autonomous System Number. An Autonomous System (AS) is an individual network with a unified internal routing policy. An AS can originate prefixes (say that they control a group of IP addresses), as well as transit prefixes (say they know how to reach specific groups of IP addresses).</p>\n<p>Cloudflare's ASN is AS13335. Every ASN needs to announce its prefix routes to the Internet using BGP; otherwise, no one will know how to connect and where to find us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-data-moves-through-a-network-of-links-and-switches\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#how-data-moves-through-a-network-of-links-and-switches\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>How data moves through a network of links and switches</h2>\n<p>There are two approaches to moving data through a network of links and switches: <strong>circuit switching</strong> and <strong>packet switching</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"circuit-switching\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#circuit-switching\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Circuit Switching</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>with <em>circuit-switched networks</em>, the resources needed along a path are reserved for the duration of the communication session. this is less efficient, since the circuit is still reserved even when no data is transmitted (ex. on phone call, the line is reserved even when no one is talking)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"packet-switching\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#packet-switching\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Packet Switching</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>with <em>packet-switched networks</em>, the resources are not reserved, and the session's messages use the resources on demand, and therefore may have to wait for access to a communication link\n<ul>\n<li>here, resources would be buffers and the link transmission rate</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Packet Switching</strong> is the process of grouping data to be placed into a packet and sent over a network. </li>\n<li>a <strong>packet switches</strong> comes in two types: routers and link-layer switches.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"examples\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#examples\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>anal: We have 2 restaurants: one that takes reservations and one that doesn't. The first has more initial setup, since we have to call to make the reservation— though there is less work to do once we arrive (circuit-switched). Meanwhile, the second takes less time to setup since we don't have to phone ahead, but we have to wait longer once we actually arrive at the restaurant (packet-switched).\n<ul>\n<li>In the non-reservable restaurant, the time spent waiting to get a table is analogous to a <em>queueing delay</em> that affects the packets. <em>Packet loss</em> would be analogous to arriving at the restaurant and encountering a big line and subsequently being asked to leave.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>ex: telephone networks are circuit-switched networks, since of you want to send data over a line, you must first establish a connection between sender and receiver. also, once a connection is made, a constant transmission rate is reserved for the duration of the connection</li>\n<li>ex: the internet on the other hand is a packet-switched network, since when data is sent over a network no bandwidth is reserved. if one of the links is congested because other packets need to be transmitted at the same time, and our packet will have to wait in a buffer at the sending side of the transmission link</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"children\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\"

Digital Garden\n\nThis Wiki of Personal Information is organized according to domains and their\nsub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git, would be `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner` etc.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nThe ability I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course, this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain, along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to make that determination.\n- be able to extract the information that we need, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":3,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Digital-Garden","siteUrl":"https://tycholiz.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Publishable tech notes","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.67.1","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true},"usePrettyRefs":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
