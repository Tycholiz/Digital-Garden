This includes external HTTP calls and complete flows within your project.</p>\n<p>In integration or E2E testing, the first step to uncovering what tests to write is to understand what could go wrong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cypress-vs-playwright\">Cypress vs Playwright<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#cypress-vs-playwright\"></a></h2>\n<p>Playwright use the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) which allows automation directly in the browser and is supported by all the modern ones. This means, it doesn't run in the execution loop of the browser and as such needs an external process (Node, ...) to drive it. It's a bit like Selenium, which by default uses its own protocol+implementation to drive the browser (the webdrivers). Note that from the version 4,Selenium is now able to use the CDP protocol and its features.</p>\n<p>Cypress is an Electron App (Native JS app on desktop) which embeds the browser window in it. The library and your code is directly injected in the execution loop of the browser and needs to modify its default behaviour to achieve this. It uses its own implementation for this purpose although a smoother integration with CDP is in progress, but it's not exposed via its API. Node is also used but the main part of the control is delegated to the custom injected library (in the same process, I guess). PW (as Puppeteer) delegates this control to the CDP implementation of the browser which is standardised and maintained by the browser providers.</p>\n<p>What are some consequences coming from these differences ?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cypress is limited to Javascript and transpiled languages as it runs in the browser. Playwright is language independant and gets by default JS/TS, Python, C# and Java support. But you can easily use it with other frameworks/languages like RobotFramework for instance.</li>\n<li>Cypress needs some adaptation for each type of browser and currently Safari is not supported. Playwright is supported on all the modern browsers and even gets experimental support for native mobile testing.</li>\n<li>CP doesn't support tabs. PW does.</li>\n<li>Support of Iframes is possible with CP but has sometimes an erratic behaviour and is harder to use than with PW in our experience.</li>\n<li>As it runs directly in the browser, you can setup some shortcuts in your test/fixtures for more efficiency with CP. It means that you can also implement Component/Unit tests with it and it's a promising feature. PW is focused on E2E/System tests and you need another framework to handle the Unit/Component testing part (Jest, Karma/Jasmine ...). You have the choice to use a single framework or 2 different with CP. On the opposite your tests are more close to the real end user's experience with PW as with CP which modifies the browser's behaviour.</li>\n<li>Although the integration with some high level (Acceptance/BDD) frameworks is possible, it's not as easy and more limited than with PW. For instance, when we integrate CP with CucumberJS the test runner is provided by CP and the structure of your scenarios and your implemented steps is more constraining. PW not only offers an integration with CucumberJS, RobotFramework, Gauge, but CodeceptJS provides also an official and excellent support for it and CP is not on their roadmap.</li>\n<li>On the CI aspect. If you don't master the building agents configuration, you probably need a containerisation solution (Docker) to deploy it. We just need npm install for PW.</li>\n<li>Another point is about test parallelisation. PW does provide it out of the box for free. CP doesn't. You'll have to subscribe to their SaaS offer to run your tests in parallel, or find some workarounds which are not perfect.</li>\n<li>Remote browsing concern: Playwright is compliant with an internal/self hosted Selenium grid (<a href=\"https://playwright.dev/docs/selenium-grid\">https://playwright.dev/docs/selenium-grid</a>). Both are supported on SaaS solutions (BrowserStack, ...)</li>\n<li>On the UI/API aspect, they are relatively close. Both provide a runner, API mocking and fixtures, advanced locators, .... PW uses a classical pattern to manage asynchronicity (async/await) and CP has chosen a kind of promise answer (dot notation, which is in definitive not totally async) to simplify the code with autocompletion. To structure and reuse your code, CP also has a different approach with custom commands to extend the cy keyword which is somewhat similar to the user centric approach of TestingLibrary or Codecept (the I prefix).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"frameworks\">Frameworks<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#frameworks\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
