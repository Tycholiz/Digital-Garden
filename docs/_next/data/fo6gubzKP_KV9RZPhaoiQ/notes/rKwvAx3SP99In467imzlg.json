class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#dns-zone\"></a></h1>\n<p>A DNS Zone is an autonomously administered piece of the <a href=\"/notes/k2zer05sauofvckrz99agvh\">namespace</a></p>\n<p>The zone contains pointers to the <a href=\"/notes/vuSZhKeQU8JmAXynHqZvf\">authoritative nameservers</a> (ie. their IP addresses).</p>\n<p>A new zone is created when a TLD (e.g. <code>.com</code>) delegates responsibility of a domain to the new owner (e.g. <code>facebook.com</code>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a new zone may or may not be created when subdomains are made (e.g. <code>developer.facebook.com</code>), depending on if <code>facebook.com</code> administrators delegate responsibility for it to other organizations. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider that there is a hierarchy in who manages each domain. The root zone is managed by ICANN. The <code>edu</code> domain is managed by EDUCAUSE, but delegates responsibility of the <code>berkley.edu</code> domain to U.C. Berkeley. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>when the authority for <code>berkley.edu</code> is delegated, a new zone is created. The new <code>berkley.edu</code> zone is now independent from <code>edu</code> and contains all domain names that end in <code>berkeley.edu</code>. Also, the <code>edu</code> zone no longer contains <code>berkley.edu</code>, since that domain now exists in a delegated zone.</li>\n<li>anal: consider that when we <a href=\"/notes/g7bXnAkewzxACR5h13tqs\">remotely mount a filesystem</a> our own, that directory structure looks like it is hosted on our machine. If I mount a <a href=\"/notes/Szj3o5iaNxPpesiCqwrbu\">NAS</a> to my local filesystem, the NAS is still responsible for the filesystem at <code>/Volumes/Synology-NAS</code>.\n<ul>\n<li>therefore, each zone can be thought of as a mounted volume to the higher level zone (ie. the <code>berkley.edu</code> zone is mounted on the <code>edu</code> zone, the <code>edu</code> zone is mounted on the root zone).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A zone contains all the domain names of the domain, unless it has been delegated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. the <code>ca</code> domain has subdomains <code>bc.ca</code>, <code>ab.ca</code>, <code>sk.ca</code>. The authority for each one <em>may</em> be delegated to <a href=\"/notes/O6qGBZUWwgsnOyTDdvSAK\">nameservers</a> in each province.\n<ul>\n<li>once authority has been delegated, the <code>ca</code> domain is only left with pointers to the subdomains.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This diagram shows how it may be the case that the <code>ca</code> domain has delegated authority of <code>ab</code>, <code>on</code> and <code>qc</code> to the respective provinces, but continues to manage the <code>bc</code> and <code>sk</code> domains (perhaps because provincial authorities in those provinces aren't yet ready to manage their own subdomains.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this shows that the <a href=\"/notes/rKwvAx3SP99In467imzlg\">zone</a> is what the nameserver loads; not the <a href=\"/notes/nu4jr5d094zri5ni0kw247w\">domain</a>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2022-03-12-20-49-28.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Domains can be very large, so they are further organized into smaller books, called, “zones.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The DNS is broken up into different zones. A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator</li>\n<li>A DNS zone is a subset, often a single domain, of the hierarchical domain name structure of the DNS\n<ul>\n<li>if DNS was a filesystem, a DNS zone would be each directory.</li>\n<li>ex. if we are talking TLD DNS zone, then examples are <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>. If we are talking Domain-level DNS, then examples are <code>facebook.com</code>, <code>google.com</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A portion of the domain name space where administrative responsibility has been delegated to a single manager</li>\n<li>The DNS Zone is described by the Zone File (aka. DNS record), which serves as the database for each nameserver.\n<ul>\n<li>The zone file contains mappings between domain names and IP addresses, along with other resources. This file is organized around resource records (A, CNAME etc.). In other words, resource records form the basis of the database. </li>\n<li>We recognize the zone file when we go to a domain registrar, click onto one of our domains, and see all of the RRs that we have made.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>a 'zone' is an area of control over namespace. A zone can include a single domain name, one domain and many subdomains, or many domain names. \n<ul>\n<li>In some cases, 'zone' is essentially equivalent with 'domain,' but this is not always true.</li>\n<li>each zone has a <em>zone serial number</em>, which is a unique identifier\n<ul>\n<li>A DNS server can quickly look up a zone's records in its database via the serial number, which will bring up the SOA record.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A common mistake is to associate a DNS zone with a domain name or a single DNS server\n<ul>\n<li>In fact, a DNS zone can contain multiple subdomains and multiple zones can exist on the same server</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We can decide which URLs should be their own zone, and which should be combined into a single zone.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Below, as far as Cloudflare subdomains go, we have <code>blog</code>, <code>support</code>, and <code>community</code>. Support and community are small, so we put them in the same zone as the main <code>cloudflare.com</code>. However, the <code>blog</code> subdomain is a robust independent site that needs separate administration, so we give it its own zone.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each below is an example of a zone:\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-03-07-15-16-30.png\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-03-07-15-16-44.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"zone-apex\">Zone Apex<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#zone-apex\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Where <code>SOA</code> and <code>NS</code> records live.

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
