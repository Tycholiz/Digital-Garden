Rather, published messages are characterized into channels, without knowledge of what (if any) subscribers there may be. Subscribers express interest in one or more channels, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what (if any) publishers there are. This decoupling of publishers and subscribers can allow for greater scalability and a more dynamic network topology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pub-Sub is a paradigm for getting real-time updates to a client. It is unlike webhooks, which would require the publisher of information to explicitly call someone who has \"signed up\" to receive it. Instead, with Pub-Sub the publisher determines that there is a certain set of information that it wants to send out, and it specifies a container (the topic) that it will be sent to. This leaves the topic open to be subscribed to, which a subscriber (a client) may do. The subscriber specifies that it is interested in receiving any new messages that arrive in a specific Topic (by name), and when new messages arrive, they are sent to the client.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This topic name would be scoped for a specific user, for instance we might call it <code>graphql:user:${userId}</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A common example of pub-sub are push notifications on mobile devices, since information preferences are expressed in advance by the user.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A client \"subscribes\" to various information \"channels\" provided by a server; whenever new content is available on one of those channels, the server pushes that information out to the client.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A subscriber receives messages either by Pub/Sub pushing them to the subscriber's chosen endpoint, or by the subscriber pulling them from the service. Upon successful receiving of the message, the subscriber informs that it was received successfully.</p>\n<p>Pub-sub is a messaging pattern whereby senders of messages (publishers) do not program the messages to be sent to the receivers (subscribers). Instead, the publishers categorize published messages into classes, without knowing who the subscribers are that will ultimately consume those messages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest to them (without any knowledge about who the publishers are)</li>\n<li>This above explanation shows that the Pub-Sub paradigm results in the publisher service and the subscriber service being decoupled from one another.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An RSS feed might be a good analogy for the Pub-Sub paradigm, if we consider that we don't really care where each post/article came from. We just get them all lumped together, and consume them there, without any real consideration to where they came from. The process is decoupled.</p>\n<p>Communication may be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>1:many (fan-out)\n<ul>\n<li>or, many clients subscribing to one topic (ie. multiple subscriptions to 1 topic)</li>\n<li>ex. Twitter,whereby one single tweet is sent to all the parties following the person sending the tweet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>many:1 (fan-in)\n<ul>\n<li>or, one client subscribing to many topics (ie. multiple subscriptions to multiple topics)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>many:many\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-03-24-10-42-17.png\" alt=\"PubSub many:1 vs 1:many\"></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The pub-sub pattern provides greater network scalability and a more dynamic network topology, with a resulting decreased flexibility to modify the publisher and the structure of the published data.</p>\n<p>Different pub-sub systems have different trade-offs, and when determining which system to use it's often worth asking the questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What happens if the producers send messages faster than the consumers can process them? \n<ul>\n<li>Broadly speaking, there are three options: \n<ol>\n<li>the system can drop messages, </li>\n<li>buffer messages in a queue, \n<ul>\n<li>If messages are buffered in a queue, it is important to understand what happens as that queue grows. Does the system crash if the queue no longer fits in memory, or does it write messages to disk? If so, how does the disk access affect the performance of the messaging system</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>apply backpressure (also known as flow control; i.e., blocking the producer from sending more messages). \n<ul>\n<li>ex. Unix pipes and TCP use backpressure: they have a small fixed-size buffer, and if it fills up, the sender is blocked until the recipient takes data out of the buffer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What happens if nodes crash or temporarily go offline? Are any messages lost? \n<ul>\n<li>As with databases, durability may require some combination of writing to disk and/or replication, which has a cost. If you can afford to sometimes lose messages, you can probably get higher throughput and lower latency on the same hardware.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"core-concepts\">Core concepts<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#core-concepts\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"topic\">Topic<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#topic\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>messages are sent to resources, which we call Topics or Streams.</li>\n<li>topics have names that uniquely identify them\n<ul>\n<li>ex. if we are subscribing to the event \"user clicks this button\", then the topic might be named <code>user-clicks-CTA</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the topics live on a server controlled by the publisher\n<ul>\n<li>ex.

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
