It defines the interface between your code and the Lambda system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You tell Lambda the entry point to your function by defining a handler in the function configuration. The runtime passes in objects to the handler that contain the invocation event and the context (such as the function name and request ID).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the handler finishes processing the first event, the runtime sends it another.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The function's class stays in memory, so clients and variables that are declared outside of the handler method in initialization code can be reused.</li>\n<li>Therefore, to save processing time on subsequent events, create reusable resources like AWS SDK clients during initialization. Once initialized, each instance of your function can process thousands of requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"when-to-use\">When to use<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#when-to-use\"></a></h3>\n<p>Unless going with a serverless architecture, Lambda is most suitable for small snippets of code that rarely change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>think of Lambda functions as part of the infrastructure rather than part of the application\n<ul>\n<li>The justification for adhering to this principle diminishes when we consider advancements like IaC (ex. <a href=\"/notes/Ku1OgHMhELajzo61Gx7ye\">Terraform</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lambda can be used as a plugin system for other AWS services, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>S3 doesn’t come with an API to resize an image after uploading it to a bucket, but with Lambda, you can add that capability to S3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"limitations\">Limitations<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#limitations\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Your functions will suffer a cold start when a function is invoked after a period of inactivity</li>\n<li>limit of 250 MB for your code bundle, including all your dependencies.

Instances of your function that are serving requests remain active for a few hours before being recycled.</p>\n<p>The runtime captures logs from your function and sends it to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. We get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the return value of the function.</li>\n<li>entries detailing when functions were invoked, and when they failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lambdas should be considered stateless, though we can use local storage and class-level objects to increase performance</p>\n<p>By default, Lambda runs your functions in a secure VPC. Lambda owns this VPC, which isn't connected to your account's default VPC.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you connect a function to a VPC in your account, the function can't access the internet unless your VPC provides access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can configure a function to mount an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system to a local directory. With Amazon EFS, your function code can access and modify shared resources safely and at high concurrency.</p>\n<p>Lambda provides runtimes for .NET (PowerShell, C#), Go, Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.</p>\n<p>It may take 5 to 10 minutes for logs to show up in <a href=\"/notes/gJBzCsQsFbZ0AESictJ8g\">Cloudwatch</a> after a Lambda function invocation.</p>\n<p>Lambdas are billed by GB/second, which means if we allocate more memory to our Lambdas, the cost/second will be higher.</p>\n<p>When using <a href=\"/notes/UkLhcujsRG1aNy2DcLcor#commonjs-imports1\">CommonJS</a>, barrel files (<code>index.js</code> file that <code>exports</code> all of the modules within the same directory) are potentially problematic with projects that implement Lambdas, since every module exported from the <code>index.js</code> file will be imported when we try to import a module.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\"

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
