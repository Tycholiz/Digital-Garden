it?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-is-it\"></a></h2>\n<p>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service that allows us control over the virtual networking environment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gives control over resource placement, connectivity, security etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use Amazon VPC to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services.</p>\n<p>VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.</li>\n<li>The network config of the VPC is highly configurable\n<ul>\n<li>ex. you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that have access to the Internet, and place your backend systems such as databases or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"why-does-it-exist\">Why does it exist?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-does-it-exist\"></a></h3>\n<p>a VPC is analogous to your home local network.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to how the devices in your home need a local IP address so the router knows where to direct traffic, your resources need to exist in a VPC so it can receive traffic.</li>\n<li>If you want the LAN (VPC) to talk to the internet, you can add a NAT Gateway (just like your home router).\n<ul>\n<li>The rest of the internet can only respond to packets from your computers. The Internet can't initiate a connection to your computers -- because they can't even get \"your\" IP address (it's un-routable, remember). They can only talk to the NAT gateway, and that only routes existing connections from the LAN.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you want your computers to respond to the Internet, you can \"poke holes in the firewall\" using various technologies such as ALB, ELB, routing, peering, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everything attached to the internet needs to be in a network. If you attached network cables directly from all the compute devices to a huge router then you'd have a huge open network with minimal control over what is allowed to talk to what. Not ideal at all if one device gets compromised and then can hack everything else right?</p>\n<p>VPC separates the giant network of the AWS data centers into smaller logically isolated networks and lets you build out rules about what networked resources you want to be able to talk to what other networked resources.</p>\n<p>Things in a VPC can't talk over the network to anything else outside of the VPC or anything else in another VPC unless you explicitly allow it. This makes VPC \"secure by default\". It starts out completely isolated from the global internet and isolated from everything else inside of AWS. Then you build out the set of minimal network access rules and routing rules you'd like to have in your network.</p>\n<p>As a side note, most of the time if you are having trouble understanding AWS networking its because of this \"secure by default\" aspect. And if your networking isn't working then 99% chance it's a missing or misconfigured security group rule, or missing networking route that means that the VPC isn't allowing this networking connection until you explicitly allow it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-use-it\">Why use it?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-use-it\"></a></h2>\n<p>Compare it to your own home network, where devices within the network can communicate with each other without too many security barriers in between. In addition to that, each device has access to the internet via the <a href=\"/notes/thpj9gdHKTOtq6O6N2PJa\">NAT</a>, but internet traffic can't come directly in.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you want something externally visible, you put it in a DMZ or public subnet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a microservices architecture, imagine you had a <a href=\"/notes/nRb6Im4Kcmc2ZWE7K1jZ1\">Serverless</a> repo with some <a href=\"/notes/OSdV9FvBG3wDbRNLllg0V\">lambdas</a>. If those lambdas needed to communicate with any of our other services (assuming they too were in the same VPC), we would need to put them in the VPC.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Serverless Framework in particular, this is just a config option in the <code>serverless.yml</code> file.</li>\n<li>Lambdas are the type of thing that should be left out of the VPC unless they absolutely need to be in it. There is a cost to putting them in the VPC. They cost more $ and have slower cold start times. They also carry more potential for connectivity issues.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. since Elasticache (AWS Redis) must run in a VPC, if our lambda needed to connect to it, the lambda would also need to exist in the same VPC.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>VPC endpoints enable you to privately connect your VPC to services hosted on AWS without requiring an Internet gateway, a NAT device, VPN, or firewall proxies</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Endpoints are horizontally scalable</li>\n<li>VPC offers two different types of endpoints: gateway type endpoints and interface type endpoints.\n<ul>\n<li>Gateway type endpoints are available only for AWS services including S3 and DynamoDB.</li>\n<li>Interface type endpoints provide private connectivity to services powered by PrivateLink.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Multiple VPCs within a single region can communicate with each other\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-11-23-12-55-44.png\"></p>\n<p>Different VPCs usually don't communicate with each other, but we can open a few ports if they really need to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-does-it-work\"></a></h2>\n<p>Process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>create your VPC</li>\n<li>add resources to it, such as EC2 and RDS instances</li>\n<li>define how your VPCs communicate with each other across accounts, Availability Zones (AZs), or Regions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>AWS VPC comprises a variety of objects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>A Virtual Private Cloud</em>: A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud.

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
