When service A calls service B to exchange information, it's similar to a phone conversation. I ask you a question, and you respond. In the meantime we're both occupied with that conversation; you have to have time to talk with me, and so do I.</p>\n<p>RabbitMQ and Kafka (and similar tools) also support two more types of communication:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Topics</em>: a topic is a one-way one to many conversation. Basically it's like standing on a soapbox and shouting to a megaphone. Whoever is interested can listen; I don't care if that is zero people or a hundred. I send my message and the broker (kafka/rabbit) makes sure whoever is subscribed to the topic all get the message.</li>\n<li><em>Queues</em>: a queue is similar to sending letters to a company. I send a letter complaining about their service, and within that company someone opens and reads this letter. I'm not involved anymore after I send  the letter. While there may be a hundred workers opening letters, only one of them is going to be handling mine. Copies don't magically appear.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So both queues and topics are one-way communication that are fire and forget (asynchronous). This as opposed to TCP (and HTTP on top of that) that are two-way synchronous communication. The broker guarantees that the other side gets the message. Depending on how you configure (for example) Kafka; you can either have a single service get a message (queue example), all of the services get the same message (topic example) or something in between.</p>\n<p>When working with microservices you want every unit to be as decoupled as possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let's say you have a component that handles user information (<code>A</code>) and you have some other module that need to do something every time a user updates his info (<code>B</code>). The classic way to do it would be to make <code>A</code> send some signal (usually an http request) to <code>B</code> so it knows it has work to do. But, for that, <code>A</code> needs to know a lot about <code>B</code>. And what if you now have <code>C</code> that needs to be triggered to? Or <code>D</code> that needs to process just some of the users? <code>A</code> would need to keep track of all of this, meanings they are highly coupled.</li>\n<li>With a broker, <code>A</code> just publishes that there's a change, and all other components can subscribe to this event and react accordingly. This way, components can be added or removed with minimal impact on the overall structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"do-you-need-kafka\">Do you need Kafka?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#do-you-need-kafka\"></a></h2>\n<p>From Reddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apachekafka/comments/hyxezo/kafka_when_to_use_and_when_not_to_use/\">thread</a>:</p>\n<p>Kafka is like an event bus for distributed messages. It can't solve the intractable problem of distributed systems, but it does provide a nice framework for handling messages at scale.</p>\n<p>I would say if you don't need Kafka, then that's a perfectly good reason not to use it. You might have a monolith, you might have a series of services that all own their data within a database, and they all communicate via REST APIs. If that works, then Kafka won't really serve a purpose.</p>\n<p>You start to need Kafka when you run into the constraints of distributed scale. If you have more events than any single worker can handle, and you've decided you can't increase the available CPU and memory any further, then you start facing distributed messaging problems.</p>\n<p>As soon as two computers located some distance from each other try to determine what is true, and what happened first, you'll run into problems. Your next goal is to try and figure out which constraints you're willing to bend.</p>\n<p>Maybe your pipeline doesn't actually care about order, but absolutely cares that you don't drop a single record. Maybe you only care about throughput. Maybe you care about order, but not about availability. Eventually somethings gotta give. Kafka just helps you manage that infrastructure, it doesn't solve the underlying issues.</p>\n<p>If you run an app that collects logs and metrics, order might not matter. Just send everything down the pipe and you'll aggregate later. But you probably wouldn't run your banking transaction on it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-kafka-in-a-logging-system\">Using Kafka in a Logging system<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#using-kafka-in-a-logging-system\"></a></h3>\n<p>\"There are plenty of open-source tools available for logging. We decided to use Graylog—an excellent tool for logging—and Apache Kafka, a messaging system to collect and digest logs from our containers. The containers send logs to Kafka, and Kafka hands them off to Graylog for indexing. We chose to make the application components send logs to Kafka themselves so that we could stream logs in an easy-to-index format. Alternatively, there are tools that retrieve logs from outside the container and forward them to a logging solution.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"ue-resources\">UE Resources<a aria-hidden=\"true\"

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
