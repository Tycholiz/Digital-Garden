Consider the access pattern that your app uses to its main database. What type of data are you querying on? For instance, if your app's business logic dictates an important access pattern as <code>albumsByArtist</code>, then our cache key structure should follow a similar pattern. Put another way, we want to be able to access our cache data with a similar mindset to how we are accessing our main database's data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cache-invalidation\">Cache invalidation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#cache-invalidation\"></a></h3>\n<p>One of the ways to achieve cache invalidation in Redis is through a built-in Pub/Sub system. It can be usd to send invalidation messages to clients listening, so that the client knows it should fetch again if it wants up to date data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This can be made to work but is tricky and costly from the point of view of the bandwidth used, because often such patterns involve sending the invalidation messages to every client in the application, even if certain clients may not have any copy of the invalidated data</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"client-side-caching-called-tracking\">Client-side Caching (called Tracking)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#client-side-caching-called-tracking\"></a></h2>\n<p>There are 2 modes to client-side caching in Redis</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>default</em> - server remembers which clients it sends data to. When the data is modified, it sends an invalidation message to the client, letting it know that its data is no longer up to date. This costs memory in the server side, since the server must keep the list of clients in memory.</li>\n<li><em>broadcast</em> - server does not attempt to remember what keys a given client accessed. Instead clients subscribe to key prefixes such as <code>object:</code> or <code>user:,</code> and will receive a notification message every time a key matching such prefix is touched.\n<ul>\n<li>does not consume any memory on the server side, but instead sends more invalidation messages to clients.</li>\n<li>The server does not store anything in the invalidation table. Instead it only uses a different Prefixes Table, where each prefix is associated to a list of clients.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is an example of the protocol:</p>\n<pre><code>Client 1 -> Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\nClient 1 -> Server: GET foo\n(The server remembers that Client 1 may have the key \"foo\" cached)\n(Client 1 may remember the value of \"foo\" inside its local memory)\nClient 2 -> Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\nServer -> Client 1: INVALIDATE \"foo\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>This looks great superficially, but if you think at 10k connected clients all asking for millions of keys in the story of each long living connection, the server would end up storing too much information. For this reason Redis uses two key ideas in order to limit the amount of memory used server side, and the CPU cost of handling the data structures implementing the feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We must create an <em>invalidation table</em> which stores rows of clients that have cached a given key.\n<ul>\n<li>Such invalidation table can contain a maximum number of entries, if a new key is inserted, the server may evict an older entry by pretending that such key was modified. Once this happens, it sends an invalidation message to the clients.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>clients do not need, by default, to tell the server what keys they are caching. Every key that is mentioned in the context of a read only command is tracked by the server, because it could be cached.</p>\n<p>This has the obvious advantage of not requiring the client to tell the server what it is caching. Moreover in many clients implementations, this is what you want, because a good solution could be to just cache everything that is not already cached, using a first-in first-out approach: we may want to cache a fixed number of objects, every new data we retrieve, we could cache it, discarding the oldest cached object. More advanced implementations may instead drop the least used object or alike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ue-resources\">UE Resources<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\"

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*.
