By distributing the data among multiple machines, a cluster of database systems can store larger dataset and handle additional requests. Sharding is necessary if a dataset is too large to be stored in a single database</p>\n<ul>\n<li>instead of vertically scaling a database with progressively heftier instances, horizontally scale by partitioning data across multiple databases, enabling us to easily spin up additional hosts to accommodate growth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each shard is responsible for storing and managing one or more chunks of data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a chunk is a contiguous range or subset of data that is stored within a specific shard.</li>\n<li>purpose is to allow for more efficient data distribution and management across the shards in a sharded database.</li>\n<li>As the data changes or the sharding configuration is modified (e.g., adding new shards), chunk migration may occur to rebalance data distribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With sharding, you would know in which shard the data lies based on the ID.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>illustration: imagine if there were 10 different shards, and the ID of the person was prefixed with a number from 0-9, signifying which shard the data could be found in. This is obviously not how it works, but a database object would have metadata about which shard it could be found in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every sharded cluster needs to have some logic in how it will place each piece of data. For instance, you might implement a simple round-robin using modulus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>photoId % 10</code> - This will spread the photos evenly around all 10 of the databases, so that where to retrieve them is predictable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"shard-key\">Shard Key<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#shard-key\"></a></h3>\n<p>The shard key is a column (in SQL) or field (in NoSQL) value that determines which shard a given row of data will exist in.</p>\n<p>What makes a good candidate for shard key?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The resulting shards should hold about the same amount of data so we don't get hotspots</li>\n<li>Choose a shard key with high cardinality. A shard key with low cardinality reduces the effectiveness of horizontal scaling in the cluster.\n<ul>\n<li>imagine the column value being an enum. How many different values could it be?</li>\n<li>ex. imagine our data table had a field <code>continent</code>, and our strategy was to shard based on which continent the user lived on. This would mean our shard key has a cardinality of <code>7</code>, meaning there can be no more than <code>7</code> chunks within the sharded cluster</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consider the most common types of queries performed in your application and how the shard key impacts query performance. The shard key should ideally align with the most frequent query patterns to minimize cross-shard queries.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. if your application frequently performs range queries on a specific attribute, using that attribute as the shard key can improve performance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Analyze the write and update patterns in your application. Consider how the shard key affects write and update operations.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. if you expect a high volume of writes for a specific set of data, distributing that data across multiple shards based on the shard key can improve write throughput.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A good shard key should be chosen based on the application's query patterns to isolate queries to specific shards. Queries that involve the shard key in the filter can be efficiently executed on a single shard, minimizing the need to search across all shards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"use-cases\">Use-cases<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#use-cases\"></a></h3>\n<p>An obvious use-case for sharding is how to store locale information in MMORPGs. Consider that the quest text for a quest in French does not have any benefit to being stored together with the English version of it. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the nature of your sharding strategy: \"let's increase lookup speed by removing the amount of rows in our database table. We can create a different table, and call it a shard of the first table. As long as the requester of the data knows which shard the data can be found in, then the result can be substantially faster queries.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another possibility is that you have a large user table which is accessed heavily. You could create 12 shards for the user data, and give each database server the responsibility over one of the twelve months.</p>\n<h2 id=\"e-resources\">E Resources<a aria-hidden=\"true\"

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
