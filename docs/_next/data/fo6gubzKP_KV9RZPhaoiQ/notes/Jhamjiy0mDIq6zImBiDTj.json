Pact takes that list of interactions and replays them onto your server (ie. Pact makes HTTP requests to your live server)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running the consumer side of the pact contract tests generates the contract itself, which is then used by the Pact broker to send the same requests to your actual provider. \n<ul>\n<li>This contract (pact) will be stored in the pact broker.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The provider then pulls the contract from the pact broker and replays this request against their local environment, by verifying the request and response match with the consumer requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a number of choices that can be made here, but usually these are the choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invoke just the controller layer (in an MVC app, or the \"Adapter\" in our diagram) and stub out layers beneath.</li>\n<li>Execute the code up to he service/business logic layer, but mock out the data persistence layer</li>\n<li>Choosing a real vs mocked out database</li>\n<li>Choosing to hit mock HTTP servers or mocks for external services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally speaking, it's easiest to test the entire service and mock out external services such as downstream APIs (which would need their own set of Pact tests)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is what gives us some of the benefit offered by <a href=\"/notes/3MvwNqq5SfLk55OoIdqkH\">integration tests</a> without the high cost of maintenance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the database can be easily set up/torn down locally, then the real database is probably easiest to use. If necessary, you can just stub out the data persistence layer.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Pact will ensure that the provider returned the expected object, but we must test that our code receives the right object.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is often the same as the object that was in the network response.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Pact Framework is of course called from within the client's testing framework (e.g. <a href=\"/notes/LgW7mTIALODoXc54B3p6S\">jest</a>).</p>\n<p>The Pact Framework offers a Pact Mock Provider and a Pact Mock Consumer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interactions\">Interactions<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#interactions\"></a></h2>\n<p>Each pact is a collection of interactions. An interaction is a request-response pair.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first step in writing a pact test is to describe this interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each interaction is considered to be independent. This means that each test only tests one interaction</p>\n<p>Pact tests operate on each interaction. They ask the question, \"assuming the provider returns the expected response for this request, does the consumer code correctly generate the request and handle the expected response?\"</p>\n<p>Usually, the interaction definition and consumer test are written together</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the interaction says \"upon receiving a POST request to /event, with an <code>event</code> object in the body, we will respond with 200 OK\"</li>\n<li>the test triggers the client code to generate the request and receive the response</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we pair the consumer test and provider verification process for each interaction, the contract between the consumer and provider is fully tested without having to spin up the services together.</p>\n<p>Interactions for HTTP and Messages look different:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For HTTP:\n<ul>\n<li>An expected request - describing what the consumer is expected to send to the provider</li>\n<li>A minimal expected response - describing the parts of the response the consumer wants the provider to return.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For messages:\n<ul>\n<li>The minimal expected message - describing the parts of the message that the consumer wants to use.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-pact-describes-a-series-of-interactions\">The pact describes a series of interactions<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-pact-describes-a-series-of-interactions\"></a></h3>\n<p>Once all of the interactions have been tested on the consumer side, the Pact framework generates a pact file, which describes each interaction:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/2022-01-19-15-36-29.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"provider-state\">Provider state<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#provider-state\"></a></h3>\n<p>If you need to describe interactions that depend on pre-existing state, you can use provider states to do it. Provider states allow you describe the preconditions on the provider required to generate the expected response - for example, the existence of specific user data. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. Instead of writing a test that says “create user 123, then log in”, you would write two separate interactions - one that says “create user 123”, and one with provider state “user 123 exists” that says “log in as user 123”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The provider should be in a particular state when a given request is replayed against it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>e.g. “when user John Doe exists” or “when user John Doe has a bank account”. </li>\n<li>These allow the same endpoint to be tested under different scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A provider state name is specified when writing the consumer specs, then, when the pact verification is set up in the provider the same name will be used to identify the set up code block that should be run before the request is executed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"provider-verification\">Provider Verification<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#provider-verification\"></a></h2>\n<p>Verification ultimately tells us if a particular pact version will work with a particular version of the provider.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when we run the verification, Pact fetches the contracts and replays each request against the provider and ensures that the provider's response matches the consumer's expectations as recorded in the pact. If the two match, then we know the consumer and provider are compatible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To verify a pact we must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>configure the URL of the pact (a path of the pact broker URL)</li>\n<li>set up data for the provider states\n<ul>\n<li>provider states allow us to set up data on the provider by injecting it straight into the data source right before the interaction is run. In this way, it can make a response that matches what the consumer expects.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>configure and run the provider app so that we can run the requests against it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every time we run a verification in CI/CD, the results are published to the Pact Broker (known as <em>verification result</em>).</p>\n<p>Whenever the provider changes, it is considered as a new <em>provider version</em> (identified at a minimum by git commit SHA + git branch)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as with a consumer, you should associate a particular version of the provider with 1+ branch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With provider verification, each request is sent to the provider, and the actual response it generates is compared with the minimal expected response described in the consumer test.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provider verification passes if each request generates a response that contains at least the data described in the minimal expected response.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many cases, your provider will need to be in a particular state (such as \"user 123 is logged in\", or \"customer 456 has an invoice #678\")</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pact enables us to do this: it allows us to set the provider state before the interaction is replayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike Consumer testing, provider verification is entirely driven by the Pact framework</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"random-data\">Random Data<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#random-data\"></a></h3>\n<p>Avoid random data. If you are using a Pact Broker to exchange pacts, then avoid using random data in your pacts. If a new pact is published that is exactly the same as a previous version that has already been verified, the existing verification results will be applied to the new pact publication. This means that you don't have to wait for the provider verification to run before deploying your consumer - you can go straight to prod. Random data makes it look like the contract has changed, and therefore you lose this optimisation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"artifacts\">Artifacts<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#artifacts\"></a></h3>\n<h4 id=\"contract\">Contract<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#contract\"></a></h4>\n<p>Pact is another word for a contract.</p>\n<p>A

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
