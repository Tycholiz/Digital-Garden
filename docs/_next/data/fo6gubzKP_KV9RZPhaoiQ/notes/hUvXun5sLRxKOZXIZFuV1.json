and can be authenticated and then authorized to perform actions in AWS.</p>\n<p>Each IAM identity can be associated with one or more policies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Policies determine what actions a user, role, or member of a user group can perform, on which AWS resources, and under what conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"user\">User<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#user\"></a></h3>\n<p>An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The IAM user uniquely represents the person or service who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A primary use for IAM users is to give people the ability to sign in to the AWS Management Console for interactive tasks and to make programmatic requests to AWS services using the API or CLI.</p>\n<p>A user in AWS consists of a name, a password, and up to 2 access keys used to access the API/CLI.</p>\n<p>When you create an IAM user, you grant it permissions by making it a member of a user group that has appropriate permission policies attached</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can also directly attaching policies to the user, though this is less recommended.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you create an IAM user, you can choose to allow console or programmatic access. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>if console access is allowed, the IAM user can sign in to the console using a user name and password. </li>\n<li>if programmatic access is allowed, the user can use access keys to work with the CLI or API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"use-an-iam-user-when\">Use an IAM user when...<a aria-hidden=\"true\"

an IAM user for yourself and use the credentials for that user when you work with AWS.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Other people in your user group need to work in your AWS account, and your user group is using no other identity mechanism.\n<ul>\n<li>In this case, create IAM users for the individuals who need access to your AWS resources, assign appropriate permissions to each user, and give each user his or her own credentials.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"user-group\">User Group<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#user-group\"></a></h3>\n<p>A user group is a collection of IAM users managed as a unit, allowing us to specify permissions for a collection of users</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. you could have a user group called <code>Admins</code> and give that user group the types of permissions that administrators typically need</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"role\">Role<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#role\"></a></h3>\n<p>A role is a collection of policies which can be applied to a user / other service.</p>\n<p>A role can only be added at time of instance and user creation though. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A role cannot be added after the fact (though permissions for that role can be)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An IAM role is very similar to a user, in that it is an identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>However, a role does not have any credentials (password or access keys) associated with it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once a role is given, it can interact with AWS via a CLI or SDK and does not need to authenticate or provide credentials (which is all done behind the scenes)</p>\n<p>A user can also assume a role, either from the same AWS account (via federated login with identity provider) or a different AWS account (via <code>AssumeRole</code>)</p>\n<p>A role is intended to be used by anyone who needs it, and therefore it is not necessarily associated with a single person.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that is, an IAM user can assume a role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we didn't have roles, the client (potentially itself a AWS service) accessing another AWS service would need to hold the access key and secret key of a user, and those credentials would be used to access the AWS resource</p>\n<h4

requests to AWS.</li>\n<li>Users in your company are authenticated in your corporate network and want to be able to use AWS without having to sign in againâ€”that is, you want to allow users to

They can either be managed by AWS or by the account holder.</li>\n<li>Inline - policies that get added directly to a single user, group or role (ie. one-to-one relationship).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
