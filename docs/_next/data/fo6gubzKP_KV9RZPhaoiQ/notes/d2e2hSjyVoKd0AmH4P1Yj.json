IP cannot even guarantee that the data arrives. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>TCP is reliable. Interestingly, TCP is built on top of IP. The question is, how is a reliable technology built on top of an unreliable one? The answer is that TCP acts as sort of the manager of a transaction of data from one place to another. If data arrives corrupted, it will repeat the request until data comes in fully-formed. It ensures that missing packets are retransmitted, duplicates are eliminated, and packets are reassembled into the order in which they were sent.</li>\n<li>Since the end-user never knows about the data-loss that might have occurred somewhere along the way, TCP is effectively an abstraction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TCP considers a packet to be lost if it is not acknowledged within some timeout (which is calculated from observed round-trip times), and lost packets are automatically retransmitted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although the application does not see the packet loss and retransmission, it does see the resulting delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TCP is said to exist between the <a href=\"/notes/5T9TTS59VHnhqvlEeGgP2\">sockets</a> of two processes</p>\n<p>On the TCP level, the tuple (source ip, source port, destination ip, destination port) must be unique for each simultaneous connection. That means a single client cannot open more than 65535 simultaneous connections to a single server. But a server can (theoretically) serve 65535 simultaneous connections per client.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So in practice the server is only limited by how much CPU power, memory etc. it has to serve requests, not by the number of TCP connections to the server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The connection between 2 processes via TCP is full-duplex, meaning the two processes can send messages to each other simultaneously.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When the application finishes sending a message, it must tear down the connection</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TCP transports application-layer messages such as HTTP requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Works by establishing a connection between 2 hosts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data is guaranteed to be delivered, and in the order it was sent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TCP breaks long messages in to shorter segments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"when-not-to-use-tcp\">When not to use TCP<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#when-not-to-use-tcp\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>TCP is not a suitable protocol for applications that require data to be transmitted in real-time or with strict timing requirements, such as audio or video streaming applications, where even minor delays or packet loss can lead to a degraded user experience. In cases like this a protocol like <a href=\"/notes/dQttRQk9tVYxtKhW5ikRp\">UDP</a> is preferred.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"tcp-flow-control\">TCP flow control<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#tcp-flow-control\"></a></h3>\n<p>TCP performs flow control (also known as congestion avoidance or backpressure), in which a node limits its own rate of sending in order to avoid overloading a network link or the receiving node. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This means additional queueing at the sender before the data even enters the network.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"contrasting-a-tcp-network-connection-with-a-circuit-switched-network-eg-telephone-connection\">Contrasting a TCP network connection with a Circuit-switched network (e.g. telephone connection)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#contrasting-a-tcp-network-connection-with-a-circuit-switched-network-eg-telephone-connection\"></a></h3>\n<p>A phone network is synchronous. </p>\n<p>When you make a call over the telephone network, it establishes a circuit: a fixed, guaranteed amount of bandwidth is allocated for the call, along the entire route between the two callers. This circuit remains in place until the call ends.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an ISDN network runs at a fixed rate of 4,000 frames per second. When a call is established, it is allocated 16 bits of space per frame. Therefore, for the duration of the call, each side is guaranteed to be able to send exactly 16 bits of audio data every 250 microseconds.</li>\n<li>even as data passes through several routers, it does not suffer from queueing, because the 16 bits of space for the call have already been reserved in the next hop of the network</li>\n<li>also, because there is no queueing, the maximum end-to-end latency of the network is fixed.

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*.
