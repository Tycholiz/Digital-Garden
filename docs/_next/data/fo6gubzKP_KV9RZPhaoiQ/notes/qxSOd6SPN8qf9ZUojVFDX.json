scheduling programs to run in a cluster.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. it can schedule...\n<ul>\n<li>long-running HTTP services, like <a href=\"/notes/q3ZzZUfqn8nRhWQXBW8P1\">GraphQL servers</a>, REST servers

schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes is all about abstracting how, when and where containers are run. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>As such, we declaratively describe what we want, and don't care how it is carried out</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes is a <a href=\"/notes/tUBvqQK65JnrN4Xc8XvqG\">container orchestrator</a>. It can also be thought of as a container scheduler.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All containers in Kubernetes are scheduled as pods\n<ul>\n<li>We don't tell Kubernetes to run a container. Rather, we tell it to create a pod that wraps a container.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes uses a <a href=\"/notes/g2jDjW3rfwpjkoQXFUDaY\">client-server architecture</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-it\">Why use it?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-use-it\"></a></h3>\n<p>Kubernetes is designed to be resilient to errors— it has one <a href=\"/notes/btan6P1szAXOhnBlAKUDR\">etcd cluster</a> storing all the state, an <a href=\"/notes/hecaydk40a6wqiprau7l8qz\">API server</a> (which is simply a REST interface to that database), and a collection of stateless <a href=\"/notes/MsBnaMq62gg9DHWeOttQy\">controllers</a> that coordinate all cluster management.</p>\n<p>It’s not enough to run containers. We need to be able to scale them, to make them fault tolerant, to provide transparent communication across a cluster</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Containers are only a low-level piece of the puzzle. The real benefits are obtained with tools that sit on top of containers. Those tools are today known as container schedulers. They are our interface. We do not manage containers, they do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes follows the ethos that we should not run our containers directly, and should instead trust Kubernetes to handle container scheduling for us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The chief reasoning for this is that containers by themselves don't provide fault tolerance. They cannot be deployed easily to the optimum spot in a cluster, and are not operator friendly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today, modern infrastructure is created from immutable images. Any upgrade is performed by building new images and performing rolling updates that will replace VMs one by one. Infrastructure dependencies are never changed at runtime</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the inherent benefits behind immutability is a clear division between infrastructure and deployments. Until not long ago, the two meshed together into an inseparable process. With infrastructure becoming a service, deployment processes can be clearly separated, thus allowing different teams, individuals, and expertise to take control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes offers us process isolation (via <a href=\"/notes/fwUzxfLSPMH1eL8oBoLWx\">Docker</a>), and an immutable way to deploy software.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can use it to deploy our services, to roll out new releases without downtime, and to scale (or de-scale) those services.</li>\n<li>We can move a Kubernetes cluster from one hosting vendor to another without changing (almost) any of the deployment and management processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“A Kubernetes cluster is a good example of an abstraction over compute resources: there are many hosted and self-managed implementations of it on different platforms, all of which offer a common API and common set of capabilities.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That is, to a large extent, it doesn't matter if you are using AWS, Azure etc. Most of the config of K8s will be identical. Thus, Kubernetes is a good abstraction over compute as a resource.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes is usually seen as a way to manage your production infrastructure. But it can be configured to manage our test environments on the fly. Imagine using Kubernetes to host a Preview environment. Every pull request can be run in an isolated test environment at the push of a button.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"isolated\" here truly means isolated. the app itself (with the code changes in the PR branch) with its own dedicated instances of SQL Server, Redis, Elasticsearch, and additional services pieces. All spun up from scratch within minutes and running in a handful of containers in a dedicated namespace, just for you and anyone who’s interested in your PR.  \n<ul>\n<li>the benefit of this really shines in a <a href=\"/notes/4JrFhUJpywlucgow6EX7j\">microservice architecture</a>. In a monorepo, you just checkout someone's branch and run the code, but how do you do that if the code depends on many external services?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"terminology\">Terminology<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#terminology\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"kubernetes-resource\">Kubernetes Resource<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#kubernetes-resource\"></a></h3>\n<p>A resource is an endpoint in the <a href=\"/notes/hecaydk40a6wqiprau7l8qz\">Kubernetes API</a> that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>ex. the built-in pods resource contains a collection of <a href=\"/notes/a9WtJDyCZ4NvEaAZ4p3bd\">Pod objects</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"parts-of-kubernetes\">Parts of Kubernetes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#parts-of-kubernetes\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"cluster\">Cluster<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#cluster\"></a></h3>\n<p>A Kubernetes cluster is a set of node machines for running containerized applications.</p>\n<p>This is composed of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <a href=\"/notes/7w1hne3hmzgbu69buj3hjgf\">master node</a></li>\n<li>the <a href=\"/notes/iuja3tlxkdniv862fq9h1v4\">worker node</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clusters in Kubernetes are identified by their respective Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"vanilla-kubernetes\">Vanilla Kubernetes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#vanilla-kubernetes\"></a></h3>\n<p>includes the bare-bones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>control-plane (which includes etcd, the api-server, a scheduler, and the controller-manager). </li>\n<li>worker nodes (with each node running a kubelet, kube-proxy, and a container runtime like Docker). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means we'll have to add ourselves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add an ingress-managed load balancer, </li>\n<li>autoscaling, </li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/dF2CVtOaqyE04VZqR8opg\">CI/CD</a></li>\n<li>and install software to handle logging, monitoring, and alerting.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"managed-kubernetes\">Managed Kubernetes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#managed-kubernetes\"></a></h3>\n<p>Kubernetes is not simple to manage installations, provisions, upgrades, SLAs and scaling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This can be handled for us with a managed Kubernetes service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A managed K8s service allows for easier cluster creation, load balancing, auto scaling, auto upgrades, auto repairs, logging, monitoring, etc.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"kubernetes-vs-docker-swarm-mode\">Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm mode<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#kubernetes-vs-docker-swarm-mode\"></a></h3>\n<p>In Kubernetes, an application can be deployed using a combination of pods, deployments, and services (or micro-services).</p>\n<p>Whereas, in Docker Swarm, applications can be deployed as services (or micro-services) in a Swarm cluster.

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
