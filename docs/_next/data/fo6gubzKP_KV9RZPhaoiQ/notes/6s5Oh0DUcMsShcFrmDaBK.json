The implication is that while only the authentication provider can sign (create) JWTs, the servers that consume JWTs can only validate them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is an asymmetric algorithm, which means that there are two keys: one public key and one private key that must be kept secret\n<ul>\n<li>The auth server has the private key used to generate the signature, and the consumer of the JWT retrieves a public key from the metadata endpoints provided by the auth server and uses it to validate the JWT signature.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the auth server cannot validate tokens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RS256 is preferred, since:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are sure that only the holder of the private key (ie. the auth server) can sign tokens, while anyone can check if the token is valid using the public key.</li>\n<li>if the private key is compromised, you can implement key rotation without having to re-deploy your application or API with the new secret (which you would have to do if using HS256).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RS256 signatures use RSA keys (which uses one key to encrypt and another to decrypt)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this isn't a hashing function, since the operation is reversible.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><p></p><p></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-use-it\">Why use it?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-use-it\"></a></h2>\n<p>The biggest advantage of JWTs (when compared to <a href=\"/notes/0NyqVKRyLLG6J1NDvFX5k\">user session management</a> using an in-memory random token) is that they enable the delegation of the authentication logic to a third-party server, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a centralized in-house auth server </li>\n<li>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</li>\n<li>third-party authentication provider like Auth0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This allows a system where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The external authentication server can be completely separate from our application server. There is no secret key that has to be shared over the network. This means all the application server has to do is check the JWT.\n<ul>\n<li>the authentication server has the private key, while the application server has the public key.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No direct live link between the application server and the authentication server is needed</li>\n<li>The application server can be completely stateless (since we don't need to keep tokens in-memory between requests). The authentication server can issue the token, send it back and then immediately discard it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only way for an attacker to impersonate a user would be to either </p>\n<ul>\n<li>steal both its username and personal login password </li>\n<li>steal the secret signing key from the Authentication server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JWTs are tamper-proof.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the days of <a href=\"/notes/gmHyIstUcxJ1M04jtEZa6\">cookie</a>-based authentication, if an attacker gained access to that cookie, they could tamper it and cause that client to issue hostile requests to the server. If an attacker tried to tamper with a JWT, it would destroy the hash and would no longer match the decoded data of the JWT.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JWTs allow servers to be decoupled from authentication.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider the <em>Basic Authentication</em> method of HTTP. In this scheme, we pass the <code>username:password</code> as a <a href=\"/notes/YYt62mSW964cwb5nP0hva\">base64</a> encoded string to the server with each request. This means that the server needs to know how to verify user account credentials. This coupling is remedied by having JWTs, since a querying client just has to present the valid JWT in order to be considered a legitimate user. Now, the server doesn't need any knowledge about authentication, it just has to know how to verify the JWT.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-they-work\">How do they work?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-do-they-work\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>User logs in with email and password</li>\n<li>The Authentication server issues a JWT to the client</li>\n<li>The client goes to view a list of private data, so a request to the resource server is made.</li>\n<li>The resource server validates the content of the payload by inspecting the signature. \n<ul>\n<li>validation can be done by using <em>asynchronous cryptographic signatures</em> or by using a shared signing key.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/2022-12-14-13-10-02.png\"></p>\n<p>There are multiple types of signature, so one of the things that the receiver needs to know is for example which type of signature to look for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is found in the header</li>\n</ul>\n<p>hashing the header and payload makes it much smaller. therefore hashing is not an functional part of it (ie. it's not about making it more secure); it's a performance part.</p>\n<h3 id=\"analogy-money-vs-cheque\">Analogy: Money vs Cheque<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#analogy-money-vs-cheque\"></a></h3>\n<p>When we give a $20 bill to someone, there is not a second thought as to where this money came from or if the bearer is the legitimate owner. The person who we are giving this money to does not need to verify with anyone of its legitimacy, and it is simply trusted</p>\n<p>On the other hand, when we pay with a cheque, a call needs to be made to the central authority (the bank) to verify if this cheque-holder is who they say they are.</p>\n<p>In this analogy, the cash is like a JWT: the system is designed where we can just trust the bearer of the money.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"token-ex-jwt\">Token (ex. JWT)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#token-ex-jwt\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When user logs in, the server creates a JWT with the secret, and sends it to the client. The client stores the JWT in local storage, and includes that JWT in every request.</li>\n<li>The biggest difference here is that the user’s state is not stored on the server, as the state is stored inside the token on the client side instead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The whole point of JWTs is to not require centralized coordination.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is why there is no <code>/logout</code> endpoint to hit when we use JWTs for authentication. Instead, we just need to delete it from local storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A JWT is just a regular javascript object that is stringified, hashed, and cryptographically signed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your token is signed with the secret, known only by the server. If someone changes the token on client side, it would fail validation and the server side framework would reject it. Therefore you can trust your token. Of course, the jwtSecret should be a secret only known by your authentication server and resource server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JWTs are agnostic to what form of authentication you are using (ex. email, OAuth etc). Regardless, the response will contain the JWT.</p>\n<p>You generate the token only if you trust the user who requested it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You trust the token as long as it has not expired and can be verified with the secret.</li>\n<li>The information in a JWT can be read by anyone, so do not put private information in a JWT. What makes JWTs secure is that unless they were signed by our secret, we can not accept the information inside the JWT as truth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JWTs guarantee that the bearer of the token also owns the data that he is requesting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>However JWTs don't guarantee encryption, which is why HTTPS is required. Otherwise, a man in the middle could take that server response (with the jwt) and use it to authenticate itself on your behalf, gaining access to all data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JWTs come with a death sentence— that is, by nature they have an expiry date.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this value is stored in the <code>iat</code> property. This can be thought of as the <code>date_of_death</code> property.</li>\n<li>The server determines the lifespan of the JWT, since it controls the expiry date. Therefore, JWTs give a uniform lifespan to all JWTs, but like God, it has control over ending your life prematurely in order to deny access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JWTs are stateless (while <a href=\"/notes/0NyqVKRyLLG6J1NDvFX5k\">sessions</a> are stateful). This fact enables them to be verified on the server, without having to make a database call. This in principle makes them faster than using sessions (since sessions need to be stored).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In reality, it's likely that the times we need to authenticate ourseleves with the JWT are also times that we need to interact with the database. This makes \"saving trips to the database\" more of a pipe-dream than a reality. At the end of the day, if we need to make a database interaction <em>and</em> authenticate ourselves, we are quicker just using a session rather than authenticating with a JWT (due to their size)\n<ul>\n<li>spec: The assumption here is that Sessions are stored in the same database as our app resources.

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
