This TCP connection is enabled by following the internet protocol. This is the point at which the internet protocol determines which routes datagrams</li>\n<li>The fact that there are 2 layers that are openly missing from the internet stack poses an interesting question: why are they not there? The reason is that the internet leaves these layers up to the application developer. The application developer can use any implementation of L5 and L6 that they choose in order to achieve their goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"routers\">Routers<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#routers\"></a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>As data is sent upstream from a networked-device, it starts at L7 and makes its way down to L1. At L1, it is connected to the link-layer switch and goes up to L2, before going back down to L1. Then it reaches the router, which goes up to L3, then back down to L1, to be repeated depending on the number of subsequent routers. At the final router, the the router's L1 communicates with the L1 of the destination host, as it makes its way back up to L7.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"airplane-trip-analogy\">Airplane trip analogy<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#airplane-trip-analogy\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As we look at the process of planning and taking an airplane, it becomes apparent that there are different layers to the entire process. In fact, each layer appears two times in the whole processâ€” in reverse order:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>buy ticket</li>\n<li>check baggage</li>\n<li>load at gate</li>\n<li>takeoff on runway</li>\n<li>airplane routing (travel)</li>\n<li>land of runway</li>\n<li>unload at gate</li>\n<li>pickup baggage</li>\n<li>complain about ticket.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>each layer implements some functionality, and we can see that the opposite action was performed in reverse order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can also see that each layer provides service to the layer below it.\n<ul>\n<li>ex. the act of checking baggage only makes sense to a ticketed person. </li>\n<li>ex. the idea of unloading at a gate only makes sense to a person on a landed plane.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>we notice that we can replace any layer in the model, as long as the functionality remains the same. In this way, layers provide consistent interfaces to each other, and don't care about each other's implementationâ€” only the outcome (ie. output) it provides.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"encapsulation\">Encapsulation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#encapsulation\"></a></h3>\n<p>as data travels each layer from L7 down to L1, additional information is added. As we pass the information encapsulated in the HTTP request down to L4, the transport layer takes the information of L7 and adds its own information to it. This information that was added is then used by the transport layer of the next node in the chain (likely the destination host). This process of encapsulation continues on down layer by layer until L1.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This idea of encapsulation thus demonstrates what is fundamentally different between each PDU: a message (L7) is an encapsulated datagram (L4). In other words, the datagram encapsulates the message. A datagram is fundamentally a message, plus some other information (provided by the layer). Therefore, at each layer, the PDU has 2 types of fields: header fields, and payload fields (the payload is just a packet from the layer above).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"miscelaneous\">Miscelaneous<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#miscelaneous\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the very fact that there are layers means that we can treat it as a modular chain, and swap out one L3 implementation for another (such as wifi for ethernet)\n<ul>\n<li>therefore L2 doesn't care if we are using IP or IPX on L3, just like L3 doesn't care if L2 uses wifi or ethernet</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The price we pay by layering is that we have to map between 32 bit IP addresses (L3) and 48 bit MAC addresses (L2).\n<ul>\n<li>The ARP protocol exists to solve this very problem</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/notes/ZaTr28eWk1DrXOEsc1YVb\">Operating System</a> may be a participant in any or all of the layers\n<ul>\n<li>ex. at L1, signal processing can be offloaded to a host CPU and that requires a driver which interfaces with the operating system</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a

Dendron vault of tech knowledge is organized according to domains and their sub-domains, along with specific implementation of those domains.\n\nFor instance, Git itself is a domain. Sub-domains of Git would include things like `commit`,\n`tags`, `reflog` etc. implementations of each of those could be `cli`, `strat`\n(strategies), `inner`, and so on.\n\nThe goal of the wiki is to present data in a manner that is from the perspective\nof a querying user. Here, a user is a programmer wanting to get key information\nfrom a specific domain. For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
