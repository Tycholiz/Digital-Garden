Imagine there were 2 postal services: 1 for your street (local), and one for the whole world (global). When you write a letter, you give it to your local postman, and he connects it to the global postal network. If you are sending your letter to the localhost network, then it is like writing a letter and handing it to yourself. If you are sending your letter to the <code>192.168</code> address, then it is like putting it in a mailbox, where your local postman proceeds to deliver it to you.\n<ul>\n<li>In this analogy it's important to note that the letter never reaches the global post network (ie the internet).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"routing-schemes\">Routing Schemes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#routing-schemes\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"broadcast\">Broadcast<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#broadcast\"></a></h3>\n<p>transfer a message to all recipients simultaneously. broadcasting refers to transmitting a packet that will be received by every device on the network</p>\n<ul>\n<li>can exist aso low as L2\n<ul>\n<li>meaning we can broadcast on ethernet</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>broadcasting is not implemented on IPv6, since it is considered wasteful to broadcast a message to all nodes, when perhaps only a few need to know about it.\n<ul>\n<li>Instead, IPv6 uses multicast</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"multicast\">Multicast<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#multicast\"></a></h3>\n<p>group communication where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>can be 1:many or many:many distribution</li>\n<li>may exist on L7 (application) or L3 (network assisted).\n<ul>\n<li>if done on L3, the sender of the data can send it in a single transmission.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>multicasting limits the pool of receivers to those that join a specific multicast receiver group.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>the combination of IP and port is an interesting thing.

For instance, if a user wants to use postgres functions\nand hasn't done them in a while, they should be able to query\n`postgres.functions` to see what information is available to them.\n\nThis wiki has been written with myself in mind. While learning each of these\ndomains, I have been sensitive to the \"aha\" moments and have noted down my\ninsights as they arose. I have refrained from capturing information that I\nconsidered obvious or otherwise non-beneficial to my own understanding.\n\nAs a result, I have allowed myself to use potentially arcane concepts to explain other ones. For example, in my note on [[unit testing|testing.method.unit]], I have made reference to the [[microservices|general.arch.microservice]] note. If these notes were made with the public in mind, this would be a very bad strategy, given that you'd have to understand microservices to be able to draw that same parallel that I've already drawn. Since these notes are written for myself, I have been fine with taking these liberties.\n\nWhat I hope to gain from this wiki is the ability to step away from any\ngiven domain for a long period of time, and be able to be passably useful for\nwhatever my goals are within a short period of time. Of course this is all\nvague sounding, and really depends on the domain along with the ends I am\ntrying to reach.\n\nTo achieve this, the system should be steadfast to:\n- be able to put information in relatively easily, without too much thought\n\trequired to its location. While location is important, Dendron makes it easy\n\tto relocate notes, if it becomes apparent that a different place makes more\n\tsense.\n- be able to extract the information that is needed, meaning there is a\n\thigh-degree in confidence in the location of the information. The idea is\n\tthat information loses a large amount of its value when it is unfindable.\n\tTherefore, a relatively strict ideology should be used when determining\n\twhere a piece of information belongs.\n\t- Some concepts might realistically belong to multiple domains. For instance, the concept of *access modifiers* can be found in both `C#` and `Typescript`. Therefore, this note should be abstracted to a common place, such as [[OOP|paradigm.oop]].\n\nThis Dendron vault is the sister component to the [General Second Brain](https://tech.kyletycholiz.com).\n\n### Tags\nThroughout the garden, I have made use of tags, which give semantic meaning to the pieces of information.\n\n- `ex.` - Denotes an *example* of the preceding piece of information\n- `spec:` - Specifies that the preceding information has some degree of *speculation* to it, and may not be 100% factual. Ideally this gets clarified over time as my understanding develops.\n- `anal:` - Denotes an *analogy* of the preceding information. Often I will attempt to link concepts to others that I have previously learned.\n- `mn:` - Denotes a *mnemonic*\n- `expl:` - Denotes an *explanation*\n\n## Resources\n### UE (Unexamined) Resources\nOften, I come across sources of information that I believe to be high-quality. They may be recommendations or found in some other way. No matter their origin, I may be in a position where I don't have the time to fully examine them (and properly extract notes), or I may not require the information at that moment in time. In cases like these, I will add reference to a section of the note called **UE Resources**. The idea is that in the future when I am ready to examine them, I have a list of resources that I can start with. This is an alternative strategy to compiling browser bookmarks, which I've found can quickly become untenable.\n\n### E (Examined) Resources\nOnce a resource has been thoroughly examined and has been mined for notes, it will be moved from *UE Resources* to *E Resources*. This is to indicate that (in my own estimation), there is nothing more to be gained from the resource that is not already in the note.\n\n### Resources\nThis heading is for inexhaustible resources. \n- A prime example would be a quality website that continually posts articles.  - Another example would be a tool, such as software that measures frequencies in a room to help acoustically treat it.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"../main/tech","name":"tech"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"The Tech Digital Garden of Kyle Tycholiz"},"github":{"cname":"tech.kyletycholiz.com","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://tech.kyletycholiz.com","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["tech"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
