This is the generated public version of Kyle Tycholiz' Dendron Second Brain. It
is made up of the public vaults. These commands work because of the folder structure existing on my
machine:

├── Dendron
    ├── main
    ├── publishable

It is generated by taking the following steps:
1. run `dendron publish export --target github`
    - A Next.js site is generated in the `docs/` directory. (Also maybe `/.next/data` too)
    - This maps to the public repo on Github
2. `git add`, `commit` and `push` the changes to Github
3. Github is set to serve the `docs/` folder of the `master` branch to deploy to Github Pages.
4. Content available at `https://tycholiz.github.io/Digital-Garden/`
